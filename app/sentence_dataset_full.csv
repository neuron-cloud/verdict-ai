"""Hey everyone! I wanted to warmly congratulate each and every one of you on being accepted into VP&S! A quick intro, my name is Mychael Delgardo, the President of the Class of 2023, and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I went to school at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where I graduated in May 2019 and matriculated to VP&S as a straight-through applicant.

ÊThen I can let you all know so a repair service can come in?,1
Maintenance went in and ran 2 cycle and could not hear any noise.Ê,1

"The plumber will be here this afternoon, between 12 and 12:30 (depending on traffic).",1
Please go ahead and replace the toilet.Ê Thank you.,1
The plumber sent an assistant to look at the toilet this week. They investigated replacing the flushing mechanism.,1
"It is a specialty toilet, ordered for a former renter who needed a power flush.Ê",1
Obtaining the power flush mechanism from Sloan company is possible but will take a while to be shipped.,1
The fastest way to resolve the problem is to replace the toilet with a standard toilet. He can do that today.,1
He estimates the new toilet price (toilet with oval bowl and parts) at around $275-$300. Labor to install is $225.,1
"He will pick up a new toilet today and install it, with approval from Stephanie.",1
We are sorry for the delay. We hoped to just replace the internal parts but it was more complicated that anticipated.,1
"Thank you for confirming in writing, and thank you very much for your patience with this repair.",1
Yes he can enter.,1
"A plumber will come on Wednesday, around or after the noon hour.",1
"If you are not home, please confirm he can enter to resolve the flush valve problem and re-set the toilet.",1
"I wanted to follow up on this, as itÕs been nearly a week since IÕve heard anything and I still have this ongoing plumbing problem.",1
Any update on when the plumber will be coming?,1

Attached is the completed form.Ê,1
"Also, I was wondering if you could go ahead and fill out a information request ticket for the EPIC login.",1
I think the personalization lab this upcoming week is a drop-in session for people who want to do specific things and as such I believe I may already need to have epic access to participate.,1
"Attached is my immunization record, which includes proof of a negative TB test done last month, as well as my most current Flu and COVID Vaccines.",1
I will need you to provide me with some of the documents listed below in preparation for your rotation at Stroger.,1
ÊhaveÊhighlightedÊthe items I need.Ê,1
IÕm almost done with the health screening. IÕve been doing it here at Columbia.,1
Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.,1
"I have everything done, including the drug test; IÕm just waiting for my TB test to come back.",1
"Thank you for you replying to my email, your profile has been updated.",1

Thank you so much for schedulingÊthis.,1
I want to let you know that the I-9 form worked for me this time around.Ê,1
Below are my first and second choices for vacations during the first two quarters.,1
One more thing about the SNS Boot Camp Ð please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions.,1
I wanted to give you a heads-up about this course.,1
" I am currently in the process of filling out the temporary license application for Illinois, and I was wondering does the Rush GME/Department of Neurosurgery reimburse residents for this?",1
It may be a day or two before I get back to you and there are a couple of other people that are interested.,1
Thanks for your interest in our homes at The Lydian. I'm here to answer your questions or schedule an appointment.,1
I am forwarding this to Brent. Don't worry GME normally provides all of this.Ê,1
ÊI am currently looking for apartments in Chicago as I prepare for my move and most of the buildings that IÕm looking at are requesting an offer letter stating my intern year salary.,1
"As such, I would like to ask if it would be possible for you to send me such an offer letter, or if you could direct me to someone who would be able to do that.",1
Congratulations on your match at Rush.,1
Great Ð just dropped it to Fedex with tracking# 775119758920.,1
"ÊI just wanted to inform you that we will be scheduling you to meet with Dr. Isabelle Germano on the day of your second-look visit, February 13thÊ, 2024.ÊÊ",1
We think you would be a great fit for Penn. Glad you feel the same!,1
It was great to meet you! I hope you had a great experience and traveled home or to your next destination safely.,1
It was nice to finally meet you and IÕm glad you enjoyed your time with us.ÊÊ,1
It was so great meeting you and the UPMC Neurosurgery family yesterday! I had a wonderful time.Ê,1
Sorry about the delay inÊsending out schedules...we had some last-minute changes as assumed.Ê,1
"Thank you for your very kind words regarding our program. It was a pleasure to finally meet you in person and as I told you during the interview, you will largely get your pick of program because of the phenomenal applicant you are.",1
My name is David Fessler and I'm one of the PGY7's at Rush.Ê,1
ÊI'm reaching out to see if you have some time for a quick phone call or zoom session in the nextÊcouple of days.,1
ÊIt's our way of trying to get to know you a bit better than a single interview day allows.Ê,1
I can also answer any questions you may have about our program.Ê,1
Let me know what time would work for you.Ê,1
IÕve reached out to Dr. Patil regarding your evaluation. Sorry for the delay. I will keep you posted.,1
I wanted to ask if you could please upload my evaluation from Cedars at your earliest convenience.,1
Dr. Black will be incorporating feedback from the residents so we will have to wait until after your rotation is complete before uploading to ERAS.,1
Did you request an ERAS Letter of recommendation from Dr. Golfinos or Dr. Orringer?,1
"If so, please forward me a copy of the ERAS letter of recommendation request with the ERAS letter ID.",1
"ÊI just wanted to let you know that you spelled my last name wrong. ItÕs Delgardo, not Delgado.",1
ÊThe reason for my email is to inform you of your registration check for your elective at NYUGSOM last block 7/3/23-7/30/23.,1
Dr. OermannÕs assistant is getting in contact with him now. Thank you for letting us know.,1
I just got to Dr. OermannÕs office and heÕs not here.,1
I just wanted to let you know in case you wanted to contact him.,1
The letter of recommendation is requested through the ERAS system.ÊÊ,1
You would enter our program and Dr. John G. Golfinos as chair for the request to be emailed directly to him.,1
"I had a question about the Sub-I, particularly letters of recommendation",1
"ÊDo we have to ask Dr. Golfinos directly for a letter of recommendation and if so, by when should we do that? Or will be done for us?",1
"Yes, I just checked and I have access. Thank you again!",1
"Thank you very much for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you as well as participating in my Cedars-Sinai Neurological Surgery Clerkship in September of 2023.",1
I just wanted to provide you with some updates to everything.Ê,1
"Sarita, a member from my institutions Office of Student Affairs, should have provided you with an email stating that I will have MOI coverage.",1
"As for the BLS training, I was finally able to get it sorted out, and I will be recertified this Wednesday, June 21.",1
"Following my recertification, I will send you the documentation verifying this.Ê",1
"Besides those two, is there anything else that you need from me in order to be all set to start the rotation next month?",1
ÊI will be sending you a picture for my security badge today as well.,1
Forward me the email from the EM resident.Ê,1
I have sent emails to Drs. Hexom (EM) and Cocoma (SICU) requesting that the rotations be cancelled.,1
I have not yet heard back from any of them. I am copying Brent here so we can keep track of everything.,1
"Mychael, obviously professionalism and accountability are out the window by now.Ê",1
"Perhaps for future reference, if cancelling rotations, appointment, etc, essentially commitments you made not only on your behalf but on behalf of others, might be a good idea as far in advance as possible.Ê",1
"I finished my meeting with Dr. Fontes, would you like to still meet outside the 5th floor tower board",1
"ÊI saw you were doing ECT today in the PACU, so I went there first.Ê",1
You can just go to the reading room and pick a fellow ot resident at the beginning. Attendings may be very busy in the earlier hours.Ê,1
If not that's ok! I can just join a station and introduce myself too.Ê,1
"ÊAgain, thank you very much for the opportunity, Sir.Ê",1
"Ok, well I want to get the full experience so I will be there at 7 am. Is there anyone I can get in touch with or look for?Ê",1
Dan will be working on it as well. Contact him to coordinate.,1
"If itÕs not too late, I am interested and would be happy to work on this under your mentorship!",1
ÊPlease send along proof of payment for the exam so I can submit for reimbursement. T,1
"Hi Rory, thank you for taking care of this and I will instruct the residents to continue to use the order set with the packs in it.Ê",1
"Can I please request a 15-minute window on Wednesday, January 29?",1
"Dr. Traynelis has asked me to reinforce the recommendations I have made verbally in one of our last meetings, re: hospital transfers to Neurosurgery.",1
Rush has chronically had a problem with hospital transfers to services other than Neurosurgery.Ê,1
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on the data from the outside place to be accurate and thus we have to verify it ourselves, particularly if it is for a patient previously operated on by our service.",1
We are at the end of the year and our program will make decisions regarding next yearÕs schedules.,1
"For the Women's and Children's area, they will have to take the safe and secure module for 2025 in the RUSH learning hub. After you complete the module, send your scores to Jennifer Black.Ê",1
Can we get Mychael access to what he asked for in his email below?Ê,1
Attached is the signed form! Please let me know if you need anything else.,1
"Hey Fernando, at your earliest convenience, can you please send me the forebearance form?",1
I have the hard copy on my desk and I am wfh today.Ê,1
Trauma is working toward ACS verification as a level I trauma center (they are currently certified at the state level).Ê,1
"That means meeting a series of standards, including response times for ""mission critical"" services.",1
"Keep in mind that our own standard within our residency is that you immediately respond in a professional manner to all consults (at county via tiger connect), regardless of service or the perceived ÒqualityÓ of the consult, and evaluate the patient in person as soon as feasible.",1
"If you are in bed, this means getting out of bed and seeing the patient.",1
"ÊIf you are doing a life saving procedure or scrubbed into a surgery providing critical assistance, this may mean seeing the patient once the procedure is over.Ê",1
"Regardless, the expectation that you respond immediately in a professional manner is universal Ñ this may mean having a nurse or other resident read the message to you while scrubbed in, with you dictating a simple response such as Òrequest noted, scrubbed into procedure right now, will evaluate ASAP.Ó",1
"As you may or may not know, there is a new chair of trauma surgery and he has made it a priority to closely monitor our response times.",1
"I am including Dr. Patwari since I had multiple conversations with him regarding this same topic, and including all the NSGY residents.",1
This topic is still part of the yearly learning modules but I could not locate the policy within the Intranet.Ê,1
Anybody who reviews the chart like Drs. Corbin and Traynelis cannot guess all that happened and it looked really bad.Ê,1
ÊIt used to be in the policy and still is in the learning module.,1
One of the applicants (see below) switched to the 11/20 date from the December date.Ê,1
He went to Mt. Sinai and likes to cook so I think you guys would have good conversation!Ê,1
"If you are receiving this, please make sure you receive your updated Flu Vaccination for the year.",1
"If you can please grant access to our 1stÊyear residents to Suite 855 pro building 3 indefinitely, we would appreciate it:",1
"Once you have sent that, I will get the security access card team to update the access for you all!",1
I was reaching out on behalf of the interns to request access to the side door entrance to 855 POB.,1
We received your email and will make sure it is updated promptly this week and moving forward.,1
"In case this seems like an abstract notion to all of you, I will give you a very palpable reason to update this spreadsheet, and accurately, until the end of the week.",1
You may have heard Vitor did not get a break from the ABNS and will need to do 6 years of residency.Ê,1
I expect your prompt attention to the case log so Brent and I can submit his paperwork next week,1
"Besides justifying all the resident and fellow positions, the spreadsheet is used to provide data for the service.Ê",1
"ÊThis is a recurring headache for all involved, so best solution is to stay on top of it monthly. Your cooperation is much appreciated.",1
Please see attached we put together for new residents.Ê,1
Some of the points are recurrent over the years so they are added in as routine reminders.Ê,1
"Yes, please forward/send that to me. Thank you.",1
"To recap, our ask with Vitrea is that their PACS user name log out time is increased to 12 hours so they can pull up films in the OR and the viewer will not close mid-case.",1
I still havenÕt heard back from Maggie.,1
My guess is that their office is closed for the holiday weekend,1
I left a voicemail with Maggie asking her to get in touch ASAP.,1
"For now, can Keshav or Manhal share what information they received, and if thereÕs anything that needs to be taken care of, please let me know and IÕll do what I can to assist. Thank you.",1
Did Maggie from SNS ever reply to this email?,1
You should now have access to the Neurosurgery Workroom on 11 in the Tower.,1
I imagine reaching out for a recommendation must not be easy for you and I will commend you on your persistence.,1
"Regarding your request, I will refer you to the last emails we exchanged on 04/14/25 re: the rotations that were set up for you.Ê",1
"While that does not formally affect your standing with the state medical board, it would be unrealistic to request ABNS credit for this year, nor would it be an honest reporting to the ABNS from our end that this year went well.Ê",1
That was the last interaction and am unaware of any other work since then.,1
"Additionally, please note that while you never formally entered probation with our program, you have not seen patients in a few months.ÊÊ",1
"Please keep in mind that at this point, my recommendation to you is to pursue a career in a different medical specialty, not neurosurgery.",1
Glad to hear you are well.Ê,1
"ÊI will connect with Isaac and Casey, no problem",1
Best of luck to you and keep in touch.,1
"Consider it done, I will get it out either tomorrow or Friday.",1
"That would be awesome, I just sent an email to Gordon and will track him down as well.",1
I'm sure Sander will help too.,1
Great to hear and super proud of your resilience and efforts.Ê,1
What is your specific area of interest forward going. I can use this to help pair you with someone.Ê,1
I was speaking with Sander this am about opportunities for you.Ê,1
"The Columbia situation is complicated by the current hiring freeze and all the uncertainty about the federal government withholding funds and Columbia's compliance to what they must change to keep federal funding as far as I can understand it but truthfully, I really have no clue what is going on unfortunately.Ê",1
ÊI think a lot of us feel the same concern and confusion.,1
Sander was wondering if you have looked at any unfilled residences like in general surgery etc.Ê,1
I have seen Gordon this week yet but I speak with him.,1
Please reach out to Sander and I will get back to you about what Gordan has to say.,1
IÕm sorry it didnÕt work out best of luck next year and please keep me postedÊ,1
Where did you end up going?,1
Amusia is a rare neurological deficit characterized by the inability to produce music,1
Amusia can,1
occur independently of global language dysfunction or aphasia.,1
"However, there has yet to be a consensus",1
concerning the localization of music production.Ê,1
"following cerebrovascular insults and has been associated with damage to different temporal,",1
"frontal, parietal, and even subcortical legions.",1
Ependymomas are the most common intramedullary tumor in adults.,1
"Patients commonly have an indolent presentation with an average age of 40 years, and commonly complain of back and neck pain that ultimately progresses to include myeloradiculopathy",1
"Pre-operative examination is critical to surgical decision making, as preoperative functional status is highly correlated with outcomes. ",1
"However, patients must be advised of some expected degree of postoperative neurologic dysfunction, and minimally symptomatic patients may benefit from a period of observation.",1
. Ependymomas are generally benign lesions though malignant subtypes occur. ,1
Neurosurgeons must be aware of non-neoplastic mimics of ependymomas as these require extensive diagnostic workup before spinal cord biopsy is considered.,1
The ability to obtain a gross total resection is largely contingent upon the pathology and whether a plane between the tumor and surrounding spinal cord can be established.,1
"If not, a subtotal resection should be opted for with close postoperative follow-up. ",1
"Here, we present an overview of the clinical presentation, radiographic and histologic findings of spinal ependymomas, as well as operative strategies to maximize safe resections and improve outcomes. ",1
We present multiple cases wherein we demonstrate our fundamental operative approach to this tumor along with surgical nuances.  ,1
"Preoperative goals of surgery, expectations for recovery, and thresholds for adjuvant treatment are discussed to enhance the readerÕs practical management of these tumors.",1
Clinical history often demonstrates gradually progressive radiculopathy or myelopathy occurring over 1-3 years,1
"Neuraxis imaging can be employed to determine if metastatic disease is present, though malignant subtypes of this disease are exceedingly rare ",1
Significant motor symptoms are more associated with larger tumors. ,1
"We recommend quoting a fairly high percentage of postoperative sensory dysfunction, roughly in the 30-50% range, on a temporary basis. ",1
Temporary motor weakness is an issue for 5-10% of patients with permanent paralysis a rare event.  ,1
"Ideally this can be avoided through consideration of a laminotomy/laminoplasty, especially for long segment ependymomas ",1
"In addition, the caliber of the thoracic cord is smaller than the cervical cord, so patients more commonly present with higher McCormick grades at surgery, and therefore have a higher risk of postoperative deficits.  ",1
Ependymomas are tumors derived from the cerebrospinal fluid-producing ependymal cells that line ventricles and the central canal ,1
"Beyond symmetric cord expansion seen in ependymomas, syrinx formation and hydromyelia are more likely to be present in ependymomas than astrocytomas, based on a retrospective review ",1
"They are more commonly found intracranially, with 50% occurring in the lateral ventricle and 35% in the fourth ventricle in our institutional series, and the remaining 17% being found in the spine ",1
"been proposed as a distinguishing feature, which is a large fusiform expansion of the spinal cord reported in an estimated 76% of cases in the literatur",1
This presentation has been thought to be due to subpial tumor growth,1
"In clinical practice, a neurosurgeon can be faced with an MRI finding of an intramedullary mass that may actually represent a non-neoplastic process. ",1
Performing a biopsy or even attempted resection can be significantly deleterious to the patient. ,1
Multiple sclerosis can initially present with sensory and motor symptoms. ,1
"In some cases, these symptoms may prompt a cervical MRI revealing an acutely demyelinating lesion in the cervical spinal cord. ",1
"The patchy and peripheral enhancement pattern, along with eccentric location in the spinal cord toward the posterior columns, can help to distinguish a plaque from an ependymoma.  ",1
These lesions rarely go beyond two vertebral levels.,1
"Beyond MS, there are a litany of rare entities that can confound neurosurgeons in their approach to a perceived intramedullary ependymoma.  ",1
We recommend caution and a thorough diagnostic workup in such cases.  ,1
This can be especially frustrating for neurosurgeons in the outpatient setting as a complete diagnostic workup can be onerous and slow-developing.  ,1
"If a repeat MRI is pursued and ultimately reveals less enhancement or less edema, an ependymoma can confidently be ruled out, as this tumor should not change over such a short period while non-neoplastic lesions can.  ",1
"When the preoperative workup is exhausted and negative, then an open biopsy must be considered as many of the above entities may not yield a positive result.",1
But the slightly atypical appearance prompted a surveillance MRI in three months and additional workup that proved negative.,1
"For cervical ependymomas, patients are positioned prone with head fixation. ",1
"Alternatively, Gardner wells tongs and an open frame table can be used, especially in the case of a patient with a larger body habitus. ",1
"During positioning, care must be taken to ensure there is adequate neck flexion",1
Localizing X-rays are obtained to confirm the levels of interest. ,1
"It is not our routine to mandate a baseline MAP level throughout the surgery, though many will use a MAP of 85 mm Hg as a goal especially during the tumor resection phase.",1
A standard subperiosteal dissection is carried out.,1
Care should be taken to preserve the arachnoid layer if possible. 4-0 silk sutures are used to tack up and reflect the dural edges. ,1
"For larger tumors, we strongly endorse early use of ultrasonic aspiration for internal debulking.",1
"For smaller tumors, ideally the tumor can be left intact so as to reduce the risk of seeding the CSF and leading to distant sites of disease in the future.",1
"As debulking proceeds, the tumor progressively collapses into the resection cavity, and the planes between the tumor and the normal spinal cord become easier to define.",1
Blunt microdissectors with occasional traction using tumor forceps and suction help to develop these planes.,1
We do emphasize patience with internal debulking as this takes pressure off of the viable spinal cord and reduces the likelihood of causing a pressure or traction related injury from dissection.,1
The dissection at the margins of the tumor are the key to extent and safety of resection.,1
Emphasis should be placed on excellent microsurgical technique under the microscope to gently retract the tumor with slight counter traction on the spinal cord in order to safely develop a plane.,1
It is a balancing act because excessive manipulation and traction on the adjacent spinal cord tissue in an effort to remove the tumor whole can induce neurologic deficits.,1
"Of the three interventions, however, patients who underwent gross total resection had the most prolonged progression-free survival, and this was the only intervention significantly associated with improvements in overall survival.",1
"In patients who underwent subtotal resection alone, the median progression-free survival was 48 months.",1
"In contrast, patients who underwent subtotal resection with adjuvant radiotherapy had a median progression-free survival of 96 months.",1
This finding supports the notion that adjuvant radiotherapy could provide some utility in terms of delaying the recurrence of spinal cord ependymomas.,1
"A very recent retrospective study by Brown et al. examining outcomes in Grade II/III ependymomas similarly found a benefit of radiation for extending progression free survival in adults, but without a significant change in overall survival",1
The role of perfusion imaging in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management is an area of intense research.,1
"Utilization of perfusion imaging in large, randomized control trials has provided important insights into infarct progression and its dependence on perfusion dynamics, leading to paradigm shifts in management from time-based to individualized, tissue-based treatment.",1
"While this has significantly aided the optimal identification of revascularization targets, little is known about reperfusion dynamics of post-revascularized tissue, and its role in secondary injury.",1
"Impaired microvascular reperfusion, despite complete macrovascular revascularization, may contribute to poor post-recanalization recovery.",1
: Results were combined across 14 published studies for analysis.,1
An exponential function fit to the percentage of patients with microvascular failure weighted by number of patients included in each study showed an average of 38% of revascularized patients demonstrating perfusion features suggestive of progressive microvascular failure (p=0.013).,1
"In all but one study, reperfusion was assessed at one point in time only, most commonly at or before 24 hours post-recanalization.",1
Conventional digital subtraction angiography was the most used modality for assessing recanalization while CT and MR perfusion imaging were the most used in assessing reperfusion.,1
"The patient was admitted to the hospital preoperatively on the night before surgery to undergo Sars-CoV-2 testing as a precaution, given the high risk of spread documented with transsphenoidal procedures.3,6 His initial PCR test was negative.",1
"The patient was intubated by the anesthesia team, who donned N95 masks with eye protection.",1
The surgical team wore standard surgical masks with eye shields.,1
A microscopic approach was used for the resection.,1
The patient was placed in a Mayfield 3-point head holder and positioned supine with the head slightly extended.,1
Brainlab navigation system was used for stereotaxis.,1
"The patient was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion, and a time-out was performed as per hospital policy.",1
The operating microscope was brought in.,1
"Under the microscope, a handheld speculum was advanced through the right nostril down to the sphenoidÕs rostrum.",1
"The mucosa was cauterized and divided, and the vomer was disarticulated and pushed to the left.",1
"The speculum was replaced with a Hardy retractor, and the rostrum was widely exposed.",1
The sphenoid was opened with pituitary and Kerrison rongeurs.,1
The sella was then localized with stereotactic guidance.,1
The sella had been enlarged and thinned out by the tumor and thus was easily opened with curettes.,1
A Kerrison was used to expand the opening to the cavernous sinuses bilaterally and up to the diaphragm.,1
Hemostasis was obtained.,1
The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion.,1
"The tumor was under a moderate amount of pressure, and the clot was expressed as soon as the dura was opened.",1
Additional soft tissue consistent with a necrotic tumor that was removed using a ring curette.,1
Hemostasis was obtained.,1
"The cavity was closed with Gelfoam placed intradurally, and DuraGen extradurally, held in place with fibrin glue.",1
"The retractors were removed, and nasal tampons were placed in each nostril bilaterally.",1
The patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery area.,1
"In this report, we present a case of vertebral artery loop causing cervical myeloradiculopathy that was treated surgically via vascular decompression.",1
"In this procedure, the tortuous vertebral artery was not directly mobilized away from the compressed nerve; instead, the C5 nerve root was decompressed indirectly, by performing a facetectomy and foraminotomy, thus relieving pressure on the root posteriorly.",1
"While vertebral artery loop formation is a relatively common anatomic variant (3% prevalence), it usually is asymptomatic, and rarely requires surgical intervention.",1
"A literature review revealed twenty reported cases of surgically treated vertebral artery loops causing cervical radiculopathy, depicted in Table 1.",1
"In fifteen (75%) of these cases, surgeons directly mobilized the tortuous vertebral artery away from the compressed nerve, either more commonly in an anterior approach or less commonly posteriorly.",1
"In the remaining five cases, decompression was performed indirectly by relieving intraforaminal pressure posteriorly, as was done in the case we present here.",1
"In all twenty of these cases, there were no reported complications, and all resulted in either resolution or improvement of pre-operative symptoms.",1
The indirect approach involves performing a posterolateral foraminotomy and laminectomy and/or posterior cervical fusion to relieve the pulsatile pressure of the artery on the nerve root.,1
"Similar to the case we present, Detwilier et al describes the use of a posterior indirect approach to treating C4 radiculopathy complicated by a vertebral artery loop in a 70-year-old man who reported symptoms of progressive right-sided cervical and scapular pain for nine years11.",1
A pulsatile mass that ended up being a tortuous vertebral artery loop was found incidentally during surgery compressing the C4 nerve root after performing a right C3/4 hemilaminectomy and complete C3/4 facetectomy.,1
"They removed the remainder of the overlying bone posteriorly that was compressing the nerve root, relieving pressure11.",1
"Surgeons considered subsequent posterior fusion, but believed it not to be warranted as there did not appear to be clinically significant instability in the C3/4 motion segment.",1
The patient achieved full resolution of his symptoms.,1
"In our case, given the underlying spondylolisthesis at C4-5 and the need for central decompression due to multisegmental cord compression, instrumentation was required.",1
"Dahdaleh et al describes another case of indirect vascular decompression of a vertebral artery loop, this time to treat a 55-year-old male with left vertebral artery loops at both C2/3 and C4/5, leading to presyncope and C5 radiculopathy that was exacerbated by neck flexion and extension.",1
"Given the multifocal and positional nature of this root compression and subsequent radiculopathy, the surgeons elected to perform a posterior cervical fusion from C2 to C6 to decompress the roots, and the patient was resolved entirely of presyncope and his C5 radiculopathy was improved16.",1
These successful cases demonstrate the efficacy of indirect decompression in treating cervical radiculopathy secondary to a vertebral artery loop.,1
Direct mobilization of the artery away from the compressed nerve root has been the most popular approach in the literature for decompression of symptomatic vertebral artery loop.,1
"In older reports, the direct approach was often done posteriorly, similar to the indirect approach discussed above.",1
"The technique involves posterior laminectomy and facetectomy, with subsequent microvascular manipulation to separate the artery from the nerve root.",1
"Sharma et al. reported a case of a 75-year-old woman that presented with a two-year history of sharp neck pain in addition to discomfort and tightness in the suboccipital region, along with an 18-month history of progressive tingling and numbness in her hands8.",1
"reported a case of a 75-year-old woman that presented with a two-year history of sharp neck pain in addition to discomfort and tightness in the suboccipital region, along with an 18-month history of progressive tingling and numbness in her hands8.",1
"Radiographic findings of the patient showed Klippel-Feil syndrome at C2-3, an ectatic vertebral artery compressing the C2 nerve root, and significant spinal canal stenosis at C4-78.",1
"Given the multifocal nature of the spinal disease, the patient ultimately underwent a C2-7 laminectomy, the vertebral artery and C2 root were then exposed and separated, and a Surgicel plug was placed between the two structures8.",1
The patient was resolved of her occipital neuralgia postoperatively with no complications8.,1
"This method is particularly challenging as the vertebral artery is anterior to the compressed nerve root, and thus is not easily visualized in the posterior surgical field.",1
"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) has become an increasingly common neurological condition worldwide,
with an estimated incidence of up to 20.6 per 100,000 persons per
year (1) and 58 per 100,000 per year for those 70 years of age and
older (2, 3).",1
"While CSDH management varies based on a host of patient characteristics and radiological factors, the mainstay of treatment is neurosurgical evacuation, typically via burr hole
drainage (most common), craniotomy, or craniectomy.",1
"Very few cases of CSDH resolve spontaneously (4), and even with surgery, hematoma recurrence occurs in 5Ð30% of reported cases (5Ð7).",1
"Several studies have used hematoma recurrence as a primary outcome variable and investigated predictors for this outcome (3, 7Ð11).",1
"The results of these analyses are quite heterogeneous, due in part to discrepancies in defining CSDH recurrence and variation in surgical and follow-up protocol (12).",1
"In contrast, few studies have investigated predictors of CSDH resolution and CSDH resolution timeÑthough post-operative residual fluid is detected in up to 80% of cases, it often does not precipitate acute symptoms and thus is typically deemed
Òclinically insignificantÓ (13).",1
"We have offered and you have agreed to accept an appointment as a member of the House Staff of The Greenwich Hospital (the ÒHospitalÓ), an affiliated hospital of Yale School of Medicine, in the specialty of Internal Medicine, at the PGY I directed by and under the supervision of the Department of Medicine (the ÒDepartmentÓ).",1

"You shall be entitled to participate in such employee benefit plans as are generally made available by the Hospital to its House Staff employees, including, but not limited to, vacation, personal days, holidays, health and disability insurance, parental leave, sick leave and professional liability insurance.",1
"All employee benefits are subject to change at the sole discretion of the Hospital, and without prior notification or approval of the beneficiary.",1
"Furthermore, your malpractice coverage will be provided by the Hospital while you are a member of the House Staff (as subject to the provision of paragraph 10 hereof).",1
"You agree to adhere to the policies, procedures and practices of the Hospital including but not limited to those set forth in the following documents: By-Laws, Rules and Regulations of the Medical Staff of Greenwich Hospital (as subject to the provisions of paragraph 15 hereof) (the Òby-lawsÓ), Internal Medicine Residency Program Policy & Procedure Manual (the ÒManualÓ); Administrative Policy and Procedure Manual; Infectious Control Manual; and the Quality Assurance Plan.",1
Copies of the by-laws and Manual will be provided to you; the remaining documents referred to in this paragraph are available for your review in the Program DirectorÕs office.,1
Employment during the term of this agreement is expressly conditioned upon your satisfactory performance throughout the academic year.,1
Decisions regarding your reappointment will be determined by the Program Director.,1
Your evaluation will be conducted in a manner consistent with those standards set forth in the Manual.,1
"Prior to the date of your appointment, you shall attest that you are in good health and able to carry out the duties of this position.",1
"You agree to cooperate with any Hospital health requirements or inquiries and to undergo reasonable examinations, tests or inoculations prior to the commitment of this appointment or during your appointment as required by the Hospital.",1
"You understand that obtaining and maintaining the basic level of health (i.e., immunizations) acceptable to the Hospital is a condition of your appointment.",1
"You further understand that the same requirements concerning your medical condition that applied when your appointment was made shall apply when you commence your House Staff appointment with the Hospital and thereafter, unless the Hospital has changed these requirements.",1
"If you learn that you have a physical, mental or medical impairment which may prevent you from performing in a reasonable manner, your patient care duties, or which may pose a potential risk of disease transmission or affect the delivery of healthcare, you agree to disclose immediately this information and the results of any related examinations or tests to the Program Director.",1
"You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to allow random testing for the use of illegal drugs or controlled substances.",1
You agree to provide promptly any and/or all information which the Hospital may request in connection with your credentials in addition to what has been submitted and also to cooperate fully with any Hospital review of your credentials at any time.,1
"You shall not participate in any medical practice or employment of any kind other than pursuant to this Agreement, except in (a) an emergency, (b) when you are on vacation with separately purchased malpractice liability insurance, (c) when the Hospital President delegates other duties to you in writing, or (d) when you formally request and the Hospital grants, permission to ÒmoonlightÓ.",1
You shall not participate in any educational activities other than pursuant to this agreement without prior written permission from your Program Director.,1
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not participate in any medical practice or employment of any kind with the express written permission of the Program Director, who will not unreasonably withhold such permission, so long as such participation does not interfere with your duties as set forth in this Agreement.",1
"Participation in medical practice, employment or educational activities absent express written consent other than pursuant to this Agreement may constitute grounds for your suspension or dismissal from the House Staff.",1
"Participation in such other medical practices or employment will not be covered by Hospital insurance, malpractice or otherwise.",1
"You agree to promptly complete medical charts, other medical records assigned to you and any or all documentation requested.",1
"You further agree that if it is determined, after providing you with notice and sufficient time to cure, that medical charts or records are incomplete, you will be suspended from performing all clinical activities at the Hospital and will be assigned to the Medical Records room to fully complete these charts or records before having your clinical privileges reinstated.",1
"You understand that Hospital patients are entitled to certain rights as set forth in The Greenwich HospitalÕs Patient Bill of Rights, a copy of which may be obtained in the Program DirectorÕs office.",1
You agree to recognize and enforce these rights and to cooperate fully with the Hospital patient representative who may inquire as to the enforcement of these rights in a particular case.,1
"You will present at all times a proper appearance (which include the wearing of a white coat and the displaying of your Hospital identification badge) and a courteous and respectful attitude toward all patients, colleagues, employees and visitors at the Hospital.",1
"You agree to cooperate fully to provide a more personal, efficient and comfortable medical care and services to Hospital patients.",1
You may terminate your appointment at any time after notice to and discussion with the Program Director and the Vice President of Medical Services and on at least sixty (60) daysÕ written notice to the Hospital after that discussion.,1
"The Hospital may terminate your appointment for cause in accordant with the provisions for such termination as may be set forth in the Manual, and as it may be amended from time to time.",1
"The Manual outlines the procedures by which grievances may be filed, complaint resolution and disciplinary action taken.",1
"House Staff members of the Medical Staff are not entitled to the procedures established in the Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of the Medical Staff relating to appeals, hearings and appellate review, the holding of office and similar provisions not intended to apply to the House Staff.",1
"You are entitled, however, to those procedures set forth in the Manual.",1
"If, after all procedures you are entitled to are exhausted, your appointment is terminated, you shall: (i) receive your stipend to the date of such termination, minus any moneys you owe the Hospital such as, but not limited to, unpaid rent you owe the Hospital, (ii) vacate the premises provided to you my the Hospital, if any, as provided in the Employee Housing Rental Agreement, and (iii) return to the Hospital all property owned by it by the end of the date on which such termination takes effect; and (iv) the Program Director shall recommend to the Hospital whether or not to extend credit to you for your participation in the program as a House Staff member, but the Program Director is not obliged to recommend that such credit be extended and the hospital is not obliged to extend any such credit.",1
"You understand and agree that the Hospital and staff may obtain from and provide to all proper parties any and/or all information as required or authorized by law or by any accreditation body, and your covenant not to sue them for doing so.",1
"History, and not necessarily the sort that professional historians are doing, is widely popular these days, even in North America, where we have tended to look toward the future rather than the past.",1
It can be partly explained by market forces.,1
"People are better educated and, particularly in the mature economies, have more leisure time and are retiring from work earlier.",1
Not everyone wants to retire to a compound in the sun and ride adult tricycles for amusement.,1
History can be helpful in making sense of the world we live in.,1
"It can also be fascinating, even fun.",1
"How can even the best novelist or playwright invent someone like Augustus Caesar or Catherine the Great, Galileo or Florence Nightingale?",1
"How can screenwriters create better action stories or human dramas than exist, thousand upon thousand, throughout the many centuries of recorded history?",1
"There is a thirst out there both for knowledge and to be entertained, and the market has responded with enthusiasm.",1
Museums and art galleries mount huge shows around historical characters like Peter the Great or on specific periods in history.,1
"Around the world, new museums open every year to commemorate moments, often grim ones, from the past.",1
China has museums devoted to Japanese atrocities committed during World War II.,1
"Washington, Jerusalem, and Montreal have Holocaust museums.",1
"Television has channels devoted entirely to history (often, it must be said, showing a past that seems to be made up largely of battles and the biographies of generals); historic sites are wilting under the tramp of tourists; history movies--think of all the recent ones on Queen Elizabeth I alone--are making money; and the proliferation of popular histories shows that publishers have a good idea of where profits are to be made.",1
"Ken Burns's documentaries, from the classic Civil War series to his one on World War II, are aired repeatedly.",1
"In Canada, Mark Starowicz's People's History drew millions of viewers.",1
"The Historica Minutes produced by the private foundation Historica, devoted to promoting Canadian history, are so popular among Canadian teenagers that they often do school projects where they make their own minutes.",1
"In the United Kingdom, David Starkey's series on British monarchs have made him rich and as famous as the kings and queens themselves.",1
"Many governments now have special departments devoted to commemorating the past--or, as it is often grandly designated, ""heritage."" In Canada, the Department of Canadian Heritage exhorts Canadians to learn about Canada's history, culture, and land: ""Heritage is our collective treasure, given to us and ours to bequeath to our children."" The term can encompass virtually anything: language, folk dances, recipes, antiques, paintings, customs, buildings.",1
"There are societies to celebrate antique cars or guns, baseball cards or matchboxes.",1
"In England, a young architect has founded the Chimneypot Preservation and Protection Society to save, as its mission decrees, ""the Sentinels of Time.""

France, which has had a particularly active Ministry of Culture for decades, declared 1980 the Annee du Patrimoine.",1
Locals dressed up to reenact the great moments of their history.,1
"In the following years, the number of heritage sites and monuments on the official list doubled.",1
"Scores of new museums--devoted to the wooden shoe, for example, or the chestnut forest--appeared.",1
"At the end of the decade, the government set up a special commission to oversee the commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the French Revolution in 1989.",1
"In France there has been an explosion of reenactments of the past, festivals, and special months, weeks, and days.",1
"The possibilities, of course, are endless: the starts and ends of wars, the births and deaths of famous people, the first publication of a book or the first performance of an opera, a strike, a demonstration, a trial, a revolution, even natural disasters.",1
And the activity is not all government inspired; much comes from local and volunteer initiatives.,1
Chalons-sur-Marne recognized the centenary of the invention of canning.,1
"It is not just in France that communities want to revisit their past: Perth, Ontario, had a week of festivities in 1993 to celebrate the giant cheese that it sent to the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893.",1
"As enterprising local governments and businesses have realized, the past is also good for tourism.",1
Governments tend to assume that proper attention and care of the past will do the present good.,1
"In the United States, the National Historic Preservation Act assumes that a sense of the past will help make good Americans.",1
"The nation's heritage must be preserved, it says, ""in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people."" President George W.",1
"Bush's executive order of 2003 titled ""Preserve America"" echoed that sentiment: ""The Federal Government shall recognize and manage the historic properties in its ownership as assets that can support department and agency missions while contributing to the vitality and economic well-being of the Nation's communities and fostering a broader appreciation for the development of the United States and its underlying values.""

The passion for the past is clearly about more than market forces or government policies.",1
"History responds to a variety of needs, from greater understanding of ourselves and our world to answers about what to do.",1
"For many human beings, an interest in the past starts with themselves.",1
That is in part a result of biology.,1
"Like other creatures, humans have a beginning and an ending, and in between lies their story.",1
It probably also has to do with the realization that today the great majority of people live in a rapidly changing world where long-standing relationships that were once taken for granted--whether with places or with people such as family or friends--no longer exist for many.,1
"Part of the current fascination with preserving heritage comes from the fear that we are losing priceless and irreplaceable pieces of the past, whether they are dying languages or decaying buildings.",1
Sometimes the preservationists seem to want time itself to stand still.,1
"In New York, to take a current debate, should the tenements of the Lower East Side be replaced by modern, more salubrious buildings?",1
"Or should they be kept, as a spokeswoman for the Tenement Museum said, ""to remind us of the experience lived and worked inside them""?",1
"Nineteen million people around the world are now signed up to the online Friends Reunited, which will put you in touch with long-lost friends from the distant past, even from your earliest school days.",1
"If anyone wants to go still further back, and an increasing number of people do, he or she can research genealogies.",1
"It is understandable, said a spokesman for the College of Arms in London, ""in a throwaway society where everything is ephemeral."" Most national archives now have special sections set aside for patrons who are investigating their family histories.",1
"Thanks to the Mormons, who collect parish registers, genealogies, and birth records for their own purposes, Salt Lake City houses an enormous worldwide collection of records.",1
"The Internet has made it even easier, with dozens of sites where you can search for your ancestors, with more specialized ones dedicated to a single family name.",1
"In Canada and the United Kingdom, the popular television show Who Do You Think You Are?",1
"caters to our fascination with celebrities and the hunt for ancestors as it traces back, often with surprising results, the family trees of the famous.",1
Recent developments in science make it possible to go beyond the printed records.,1
The decoding of DNA means that scientists can now trace an individual's ancestry back through the mother's line and can find others with the same genetic makeup.,1
"As the databases of information build up, it becomes increasingly possible to see how human beings have migrated over the years.",1
This is important for anyone who wants to go back beyond where the paper trail peters out.,1
It is particularly important for those who never had much of a paper trail to begin with.,1
"Those immigrants who came in great waves to the New World in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to escape a miserable and uncertain life in Europe often lost all links with their pasts, sometimes indeed even their old names.",1
"For the descendants of American slaves, who lacked even the faintest hope of recovering the path their ancestors followed from Africa and not much more chance of finding out what happened to them once they were in the United States, DNA has suddenly opened the door to self-knowledge.",1
"A moving program called African American Lives, which was broadcast by PBS in 2006, looked at the DNA of famous black Americans, Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones among them.",1
Sometimes the results are disappointing: family stories about the great-grandparent who was descended from kings are often just that--stories.,1
"Sometimes there are surprises, as when an obscure professor of accounting in Florida found he was descended from Genghis Khan.",1
"Perhaps, thought the professor, he owed his administrative skills to his terrifying ancestor.",1
"The current fascination for people's personal histories can be narcissistic--how much time should human beings spend gazing at themselves, after all?--but it also comes from the desire to know more about what made people who they are and what made the world in which they happen to live.",1
"If people can stand back and see their own histories in a wider perspective, then they can see how they are the products not just of particular individuals but of whole societies and cultures.",1
"Members of certain ethnic groups may find that they have inherited views on other ethnic groups, and may also find that others regard them in particular ways.",1
"History has shaped humans' values, their fears, their aspirations, their loves, and their hatreds.",1
"When we start to realize that, we begin to understand something of the power of the past.",1
"Even when people think they are striking out in new directions, their models often come from the past.",1
"How often have we seen revolutionaries, committed to building new worlds, slip back unconsciously into the habits and ways of those they have replaced?",1
"Napoleon came to power as the result of the French Revolution, but the court he set up was modeled on that of the displaced Bourbons.",1
"The top Soviet Communists lived within the walls of the Kremlin, as the czars had once done.",1
"Stalin looked back to Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great as his predecessors, as, I suspect, Vladimir Putin did when he was president.",1
"The Chinese Communists scorned China's traditional society, but their top leaders chose to live right at the heart of Beijing, where the imperial court had once been.",1
"Mao Zedong himself withdrew into mysterious seclusion, much as the emperors had done over the centuries.",1
"""Men make their own history,"" said Karl Marx, ""but they do not make it as they please: they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.""

During the Cold War, though, history appeared to have lost much of its old power.",1
"The world that came into being after 1945 was divided up between two great alliance systems and two competing ideologies, both of which claimed to represent the future of humanity.",1
"American liberal capitalism and Soviet-style Communism were about, so they said, building new societies, perhaps even new human beings.",1
"The old conflicts, between Serbs and Croats, Germans and French, or Christians and Muslims, were just that and were consigned, in Leon Trotsky's memorable phrase, to the dustbin of history.",1
"The threat of massive nuclear war, of course, was always present, and from time to time, during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, it looked as if the last moment of the planet had come.",1
"But it did not, and in the end most of us simply forgot about the danger.",1
"Nuclear weapons took on a benign aspect: after all, the balance of terror meant that neither superpower dared attack the other without risking its own destruction.",1
"People at the time assumed that the United States and the Soviet Union would remain locked in their conflict, between war and peace, perhaps forever.",1
"In the meantime, the developed world enjoyed unparalleled prosperity, and new economic powers, many in Asia, appeared on the scene.",1
My students used to tell me how lucky I was to be teaching history.,1
"Once you have got a period or the events of a war straight, so they assumed, you don't have to think about them again.",1
"It must be so nice, they would say, not to redo your lecture notes.",1
"The past, after all, is the past.",1
It cannot be changed.,1
"History, they seemed to say, is no more demanding than digging a stone out of the ground.",1
It can be fun to do but not really necessary.,1
What does it matter what happened then?,1
This is now.,1
"When the Cold War abruptly ended in 1989 with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in Europe, the world enjoyed a brief, much too brief, period of optimism.",1
"Collectively, it failed to recognize that the certainties of the post-1945 years had been replaced by a more complicated international order.",1
"Instead, most people assumed that as the remaining superpower, the United States would surely become a benevolent hegemon.",1
"Societies would benefit from a ""peace dividend"" because there would be no more need to spend huge amounts on the military.",1
Liberal democracy had triumphed and Marxism itself had gone into the dustbin.,1
"History, as Francis Fukuyama put it, had come to an end, and a contented, prosperous, and peaceful world was moving into the next millennium.",1
"In fact, many of the old conflicts and tensions remained, frozen into place just under the surface of the Cold War.",1
"The end of that great struggle brought a thaw, and long-suppressed dreams and hatreds bubbled to the surface again.",1
"Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded Kuwait, basing its claims on dubious history.",1
"We discovered that it mattered that Serbs and Croats had many historical reasons to fear and hate each other, and that there were peoples within the Soviet Union who had their own proud histories and who wanted their independence.",1
Many of us had to learn who the Serbs and Croats were and where Armenia or Georgia lay on the map.,1
"In the words of the title of Misha Glenny's book on central Europe, we witnessed the rebirth of history.",1
"Of course, as so often happens, some people went too far the other way and blamed everything that was going wrong in the Balkans in the 1990s, to take one of the most egregious cases, on ""age-old hatreds,"" which conveniently overlooked the wickedness of Slobodan Milosevic, then the president, and his ilk, who were doing their best to destroy Yugoslavia and dismember Bosnia.",1
Such an attitude allowed outside powers to stand by wringing their hands helplessly for far too long.,1
"The last two decades have been troubled and bewildering ones, and, not surprisingly, many people have turned to history to try to understand what is going on.",1
Books on the history of the Balkans sold well as Yugoslavia fell to pieces.,1
"Today, publishers are rushing to commission histories of Iraq or to reissue older works.",1
"Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom, which describes the Arab struggle against Turkey for independence, is a bestseller again, and particularly popular with American soldiers serving in Iraq.",1
"My own book on the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where so much of the foundation of the modern world was laid, could not find a publisher in the 1980s.",1
"As one publisher said, no one wanted to read about a bunch of dead white men sitting around talking about long-forgotten peace settlements.",1
"By the 1990s, the subject had come to seem a lot more relevant.",1
Today's world is far removed from the stasis of the Cold War.,1
It looks more like that of the decade before 1914 and the outbreak of World War I or the world of the 1920s.,1
"In those days, as the British Empire started to weaken and other powers, from Germany to Japan to the United States, challenged it for hegemony, the international system became unstable.",1
"Today, the United States still towers over the other powers but not as much as it once did.",1
"It has been badly damaged by its involvement in Iraq, and it faces challenges from the rising Asian powers of China and India and its old rival Russia.",1
"Economic troubles bring, as they brought in the past, domestic pressures for protection and trade barriers.",1
"Ideologies--then Fascism and Communism, now religious fundamentalisms--challenge the assumptions of liberal internationalism and wage war on powers they see standing in their way.",1
"And the world still has, as it had in the first half of the twentieth century, the unreasoning forces of ethnic nationalism.",1

"We had this superstition in the kitchen: on Fridays, no one counted heads.",1
"No one counted tables at the end of the night, no one counted covers.",1
"When the last table was cleared, the dupes were just left there, mounded up on the spike.",1
"You didn't look, not even in secret.",1
No one even guessed.,1
Bad things would happen if you did.,1
"And even though no one looked, bad things happened anyway.",1
"Lane died on a Friday night due to complications of lifestyle--which is to say, he was shot by an acquaintance in a squabble over twenty dollars' worth of shitty brown horse.",1
He wasn't found until Saturday morning; no one thought to call the restaurant to let us know that he wouldn't be coming in to work that day.,1
He was just considered AWOL--a no-call/no-show that left the line a man short going into the early-bird rush.,1
"This was Tampa, Florida, in the middle nineties--a bad time for cuisine, a worse place.",1
"It wasn't a great time for me, either.",1
"Worse for Lane, I guess, but everything is a matter of degrees.",1
"Of right and wrong places, right and wrong times.",1
"Eventually, Lane's name was found in a late edition of the Tampa paper.",1
Or maybe someone saw it on TV.,1
I don't remember.,1
"In any event, we all found out, precisely too fucking late, that Lane was now fry-cooking in the sweet hereafter.",1
The first hit was due in soon.,1
"And while there is a lot of voodoo in the air down in Florida, no one wanted to bet heavy on the long odds of Lane coming back as a zombie and retaking his place on the line.",1
He'd been shit as a living cook anyhow.,1
Being newly undead would probably only slow him worse than the smack had.,1
"""This is why cooks should always have the decency to die in a public place,"" said Floyd, the kitchen manager and nominal chef.",1
"""That way, they make the morning paper and we'd know who isn't showing up for work.""

In the kitchen, we discussed the best methods for dying in a spectacularly newsworthy fashion, and Floyd promoted one of the afternoon prep crew into Lane's slot on the line.",1
The FNG--the Fucking New Guy--went on fryers.,1
"It was my fourth night on the line at Jimmy's Crab Shack, and no longer the F-ingest NG, I was brevetted to grill/steamer, working beside Sturgis, who was grill/top.",1
"Saturday night, early, no one was able to find a rhythm.",1
"We kept getting popped, then stalled, taking five tables like BangBangBang-BangBang, then nothing for ten minutes.",1
The FNG fell into the weeds--dans la merde even at this stuttering half-speed.,1
"Jimmy, the owner, was antsy on expo, alternating between giggling fits and bouts of screaming obscenity.",1
Floyd rotated the line out for cigarettes.,1
"He had a speed pourer filled with rum and hurricane mix in his rack that he sucked at like a baby with a bottle, and he jumped on every check out of the printer as if it were the harbinger of the rush that steadfastly refused to come.",1
"It was difficult to see from the grill station at one end of the line to the fryers at the other because of the wavy heat-haze--the air squirming, like staring through aquarium water.",1
Five o'clock came and went.,1
It seemed to me suddenly like there wasn't enough air on the line for all of us to breathe.,1
I had chills.,1
Cold flashes skittered up and down my spine while my front half baked.,1
"This being Florida and me being too young for menopause, I imagined it was malaria and stood firm, waiting for the hallucinations to kick in.",1
"With the ventilation hood going full blast, Roberto and Chachi couldn't keep the pilots on their unused burners going so had to keep kissing them back to life--leaning over and blowing across the palms of their hands to get the flame from one to jump to the next with the gas turned all the way up.",1
The alternative method: smacking a pan down on the grate at an angle and hard enough to catch a spark.,1
They did it over and over again until Floyd yelled at them to quit it.,1
"After that, they fought over the galley radio.",1
"After that, they amused themselves by drinking the cooking wine (sieved through a coffee filter to separate out all the grease and floating crap and then mixed with orange soda) and pegging frozen mushroom caps at Jimmy whenever his back was turned.",1
"At some point, Jimmy--in an attempt to catch whoever was throwing things at him, and half in the bag to begin with--spun around too fast, caught his foot on the edge of one of the kitchen mats and went down hard, his head spanging off the rounded edge of the expo table with a sound like someone throwing a melon at a gong.",1
He was unconscious before he hit the floor.,1
"There was an instant of shocked silence, then a crashing wave of laughter.",1
"Seeing anyone fall down is funny, but seeing a drunken fat man fall down beats all.",1
"One of the waitresses ran for the hostess (who also doubled as FOH manager), and she came at the best sprint she could manage in her stiletto heels and stirrup pants.",1
"The prep/runner crew treated Jimmy like any other heat casualty, breaking in a wing and descending like Stukas to drag him clear of the flow of service.",1
It took four of them.,1
Jimmy was a big man and moving him was like trying to roll a beached whale back into the sea.,1
"They dumped him, loose-jointed, beside the cooler and calmly went back about their business.",1
"Jimmy's T-shirt (Pantera on that day, I think, black and sleeveless, making his thick, pasty-white arms look like they were made of lard) rode up over his hairy, pony-keg belly.",1
His eyes were closed.,1
"There was no blood, which secretly disappointed us all.",1
Floyd spoke to the line.,1
"""No one cops to this.",1
"No one snitches.""",1
"As was only to be expected, that was when the real dinner hit finally came tumbling in.",1
With the hostess seeing to Jimmy (and probably quietly looking to see how she could get at his wallet) the floor was left unmanaged.,1
Waitresses double- and triple-sat their own sections in the absence of an egalitarian hand.,1
The ticket machine began to spit.,1
"Like a pro, Roberto false-called a half dozen steaks to the grill, crabs to the steamers, and twenty-upped fries to get things rolling in anticipation of steaks going well-done and missed sides down the line, then started working actual tickets, hanging them ten at a time.",1
The machine didn't stop.,1
"The paper strip grew long, drooping like a tongue, spooling out and down onto the floor.",1
"On the galley radio, the DJ came back from a commercial and kicked into the Misfits doing ""Ballroom Blitz,"" and I--up to my wrists in meat and blood, crouching down at the lowboy trying to retrieve cheap-ass skirts and vacpac T-bones from the dim interior--yelled that I'd kill the next cocksucking motherfucker that touched the dial.",1
"After that, we were in it, the machinery in motion.",1
"Sturgis and I sang along with the radio, bouncing on our toes, burning energy while we had it and twirling tongs on our fingers like gunslingers before dropping them onto the steamer's bar handles.",1
"We shouted callbacks to Floyd with the strange, exaggerated politeness and house slang of the line: ""Firing tables fifty-five, thirty, sixty-eight, thank you.",1
Going on eight fillet.,1
"Four well, three middy, one rare.",1
"Working fourteen all day, hold six.",1
Five strip up and down.,1
"Temps rare, rare, middy waiting on po fries, two well going baker, thank you.",1
"Wheel, new fires, please.",1
"We've got space.""",1
"We yelled at the runners to bring more compound butter and plates of oil (a cheap trick for getting those grill marks to char faster--dragging the steaks through cheap salad oil, which scorched up black and nutty in seconds), and when we weren't yelling, we were muttering, cursing, talking to the meat, the fire; begging and cajoling more heat out of the grills, bricking the steaks with iron weights, throwing them in the microwave to speed them along to temp, constantly poking and prodding and plating them to the rail; waiting for po--for starch--and veg and wrap.",1
"Jimmy regained consciousness and sat glaze-eyed, staring and concussed on the floor until he was capable of standing without help.",1
"He retook expo like the marines taking a hill: lurching, wild-eyed and under fire.",1
Floyd came back onto the line at the wheel.,1
"Roberto surrendered his position without a word, just turning and going straight back to his burners one step away with no interruption in the flow of orders.",1
"On fryers, the FNG was so deep in the weeds and lost that Dump had to crutch him full-time while I racked and emptied the stinking steamers, leaving dozens of pounds of crab legs and freezerburned lobster tails and hundreds of clams to die in hotel pans under the heat lamps.",1
The smell was É,1
"He ordered Roberto to the wheel, shifted Dump, the roundsman, from second steamer (backing me) to second fryer (backing the new FNG), and vaulted the line to take Jimmy's place at expo himself.",1
"We yelled at Roberto, at Floyd, at the radio and each other.",1
staggering.,1
Then the FNG passed out from the heat.,1
"The runners plunged onto the line, hip-checking their way through the chaos to drag him off.",1
"Floyd shouted, ""Hydrate that bitch!""",1
"He came to with a scream, sputtering and kicking, and while he recovered, another runner stood stage at his station, slicing bags of fries open with a silver butterfly knife he'd pulled out of his pocket and emptying them straight into the smoking fryers; fishing out an order at a time with long tongs and setting up sell plates under the lamps to catch up, his fist wrapped in a wet side towel to defend against the rivulets of hot oil that ran back down the grooves--another good trick, one that the FNG just hadn't had time yet to learn.",1
The night rolled on.,1
Ice buckets were called for and installed at each station.,1
You bent down and stuck your whole head in whenever you started to see fireworks--sure sign of an impending blackout.,1
"A plastic bottle of cornstarch made the rounds, everyone on the line dumping the stuff right down the front of our chef pants to soak up the sweat and keep the tackle from sticking.",1
"""Making pancakes,"" that was called, from the way the starch caked up on either side of one's ballsack.",1
I went down around nine.,1
I felt it coming--the blackness squeezing into my head like heavy velvet.,1
"There was time enough to step back so I didn't topple over on the grill, then just the sensation of falling for miles.",1
"Mark of one's perceived toughness: I was hydrated on the spot, Sturgis upending an ice bucket onto me while Floyd frantically waved off the runners.",1
The floor was ankle-deep in shit--food scraps and packaging and dropped utensils and dirty towels.,1
"All the detritus of a killer service in a restaurant where people didn't care as much about what they were eating as they did about its being served fast, cheap and in gargantuan portions.",1
"I lay there on my back like I was trying to make a garbage angel, blinking, gasping and spitting.",1
"When I stood up again, I had a crab leg stuck in my hair.",1
Sturgis called me Crab Head from then on out.,1
"I went right back to the grill-not because I was so tough or because I wanted to, but because I was too embarrassed to do anything else.",1
I had to strip out of my chef coat and T-shirt because the water in them started to boil.,1
The guys whistled at me.,1
"Sturgis rubbed my thin, bare belly.",1
"A runner brought me a dry jacket, and while I was shrugging into it, there was a sudden, odd quiet.",1
The ticket machine had paused--first time since the rush had begun in earnest.,1
We all stared as if it were our own hearts that'd stopped beating.,1
"""Fire all!"" Floyd yelled.",1
"""Hang 'em and bang 'em.",1
"Expo, all call."" We ran the rail, cooking everything in sight in one massive push to get ahead of the curve.",1
"And when it was done, Sturgis and I cooked through the last half hour of service on autopilot, going on gut and reflex with sore hands and boiling blood and eyes like broken windowpanes.",1
"Things were winding down, the siege broken, the fort once again saved from the Indians, whatever.",1
"We wiped down, wrapped and stored our station while the last of the straggling tables cleared, then gave the line over to the prep crew, who were also responsible for all the heavy cleaning.",1
Four hours had snapped past like a minute.,1
This was The Life.,1
"The part they can't teach in culinary school, don't ever show on TV.",1
"The unscheduled death and disasters and heat and blistering adrenaline highs, the tunnel vision, the crashing din, smell of calluses burning, crushing pressure and pure, raw joy of it all as the entire rest of the world falls away and your whole universe becomes a small, hot steel box filled with knives and meat and fire; everything turning on the next call, the next fire order, the twenty, thirty, forty steaks in front of you and the hundreds on the way.",1
This was what made everything else forgivable.,1
"And I knew that if I could just do this one thing, all night, every night, under the worst conditions and without fail, nothing else mattered.",1
"Please, God, just this.",1
The rest is only details.,1
"We retired, with the rest of the crew, first to the dock to pass a bowl around and hammer down cigarettes, then to the locker room to change, then to the bathroom--transformed briefly into a whitetrash version of Studio 54 with ugly men in terrible clothing dryswallowing OxyContin tablets or tying off in the stalls with the proficiency of practiced habit--then, finally, to the bar, where the air tasted of tin and overworked air-conditioning machinery and the hostess stood pouring restorative cocktails of pineapple juice and well vodka into finger-smudged highball glasses.",1
"It took a minimum of two drinks before any of us were able to get it together enough to speak, three before what came out of our mouths approached language.",1
"We talked about the night the way impressionists painted, in splashes of color and hard, angular jive; speaking in broken sentences, disjointed bursts of wasted rage mixed with thumping bravado bouncing back and forth while we sat, all clotted up around the service end of the bar in too few chairs as if, even in an empty dining room, we strove to isolate ourselves from where the customers--the enemy--sat and business was done.",1
"Floyd sat slumped over with his arms folded on the bar top, head resting on his crossed wrists.",1
"Sturgis and Chachi were chattering at each other like monkeys, grooving on the same Colombian frequency.",1
"Roberto and I sat bracketing the FNG (who'd finished out the night standing, which was noble enough), filling him with liquor and trying to name him now that his cherry had been popped; running down a list of funny Spanish words, French, kitchen slang, settling finally on Chupo--garbled Spanish for ""I suck.""

Jimmy came teetering out of the kitchen like a sea captain negotiating a rolling, rain-slick deck.",1
"The entire left side of his head had swollen like he'd caught half a case of encephalitis, but he said nothing about it--seeming to have forgotten the mushroom-cap mutiny entirely, like it was a hundred years ago and never that big a deal to begin with.",1
"He squeezed my shoulder in passing, patted Roberto's belly, grabbed Chupo by the back of the neck and shook him like a puppy, telling him he'd done good, that he would be on the line again tomorrow night, and that he shouldn't be drinking because he was only eighteen, but if anyone outside the house said boo to him, to just tell them he'd robbed a liquor store.",1
Jimmy made the rounds and ended up at the bar beside Floyd.,1
"I watched him lay a hand gently on his top guy's back, between Floyd's bony shoulders.",1
"They talked too quiet for me to hear, but Floyd would raise his head only to answer direct questions, staring off into some weird middle space between his eyes and the bar mirror when he did, then settling his head back again onto his arms.",1
"He looked like some wasted angel, a stick-skinny cherub, a galley saint--white as alabaster, beat to shit, spacey from the junk and exhausted.",1
No one lasted more than a few hours or a few days on the line at Jimmy's Crab Shack.,1
"If you made it a month, you were almost like family.",1
Floyd had been holding down his post for two years.,1
The FNG was dumped over a floor grate near the coolers and doused with ice water.,1
"What was next was a swift retreat back into the warm, close embrace of a gang of cooks doing what cooks do best when there's no more work to be done, which is everything possible to stall off having to leave the orbit of their kitchens, the nocturnal world and closed society of this thing of ours.",1
"To be in that--to be buried and surrounded by it, regulated by it, protected by it--was a comfort.",1
"It meant never having to be bothered by the big moments, the big questions.",1
So whether I found clarity there on the dock that night is immaterial.,1
"Whether I looked deep into my soul, wept and gnashed my teeth over blown opportunities and potential pissed away, or simply stood for a minute or two or ten, lost in the quiet and hot, wet dark.",1
"What matters is what I did, and what I did was turn my back on the outside, square up my head and go back to the bar.",1
What's next?,1
Tomorrow night's shift and tomorrow night's disasters.,1
And how the fuck did I end up here?,1
Because I couldn't remember ever wanting anything else.,1
Anax moved down the long corridor.,1
The only sound was the gentle hiss of the air filter overhead.,1
"The lights were down low, as demanded by the new regulations.",1
"She remembered brighter days, but never spoke of them.",1
"It was one of the Great Mistakes, thinking of brightness as a quality of the past.",1
Anax reached the end of the corridor and turned left.,1
She checked the time.,1
"They would be watching her approach, or so it was rumored.",1
"The door slid open, quiet and smooth, like everything in The Academy zone.",1
"""Anaximander?""",1
"The panel was made up of three Examiners, just as the regulations had promised.",1
It was a great relief.,1
"Details of the examination were kept secret, and among the candidates rumors swirled.",1
"""Imagination is the bastard child of time and ignorance,"" her tutor Pericles liked to say, always adding ""not that I have anything against bastards.""

Anax loved her tutor.",1
She would not let him down.,1
The door closed behind her.,1
"The Examiners sat behind a high desk, the top a dark slab of polished timber.",1
"""Make yourself comfortable."" The Examiner in the middle spoke.",1
"He was the largest of the three, as tall and broad as any Anax had ever seen.",1
"By comparison the other two looked old and weak, but she felt their eyes upon her, keen and sharp.",1
Today she would assume nothing.,1
The space before them was clear.,1
Anax knew the interview was being recorded.,1
EXAMINER: Four hours have been allotted for your examination.,1
"You may seek clarification, should you have trouble understanding any of our questions, but the need to do this will be taken into consideration when the final judgment is made.",1
Do you understand this?,1
ANAXIMANDER: Yes.,1
"EXAMINER: Is there anything you would like to ask, before we begin?",1
ANAXIMANDER: I would like to ask you what the answers are.,1
EXAMINER: I'm sorry.,1
I don't quite understand .,1
 Anax nodded.,1
ANAXIMANDER: I was joking.,1
EXAMINER: Oh.,1
I see.,1
A bad idea.,1
Not so much as a flicker of acknowledgment from any of them.,1
"Anax wondered whether she should apologize, but the gap closed quickly over.",1
"EXAMINER: Anaximander, your time begins now.",1
Four hours on your chosen subject.,1
"The life and times of Adam Forde, 2058-2077.",1
Adam Forde was born seven years into the age of Plato's Republic.,1
Can you please explain to us the political circumstances that led to The Republic's formation?,1
Was this a trick?,1
Anax's topic clearly stated her area of expertise covered the years of Adam's life only.,1
The proposal had been accepted by the committee without amendment.,1
"She knew a little of the political background of course, everybody did, but it was not her area of expertise.",1
"All she could offer was a classroom recitation, familiar to every student.",1
This was no way to start.,1
Should she challenge it?,1
Were they expecting her to challenge it?,1
"She looked to their faces for clues, but they sat impassive as stone, offering her nothing.",1
"EXAMINER: Anaximander, did you understand the question?",1
ANAXIMANDER: Of course I did.,1
I'm sorry.,1
I'm just .,1
it doesn't matter .,1
Anax tried to clear her mind of worries.,1
Four hours.,1
Plenty of time to show how much she knew.,1
ANAXIMANDER: The story begins at the end of the third decade of the new millennium.,1
"As with any age, there was no shortage of doomsayers.",1
Early attempts at genetic engineering had frightened large sectors of the community.,1
"The international economy was still oil based, and the growing consensus was that a catastrophic shortage loomed.",1
"What was then known as the Middle East remained a politically troubled region, and the United States - I will use the designations of the time for consistency - was seen by many to have embroiled itself in a war it could not win, with a culture it did not understand.",1
"While it promoted its interests as those of democracy, the definition was narrow and idiosyncratic, and made for a poor export.",1
"Fundamentalism was on the rise on both sides of this divide, and the first clear incidents of Western Terrorism in Saudi Arabia in 2032 were seen by many as the spark for a fire that would never be doused.",1
Europe was accused of having lost its moral compass and the independence riots of 2047 were seen as further evidence of secular decay.,1
"China's rise to international prominence, and what it called ""active diplomacy,"" led many to fear that another global conflict was on the horizon.",1
Economic expansion threatened the global environment.,1
"Biodiversity shrank at unprecedented rates, and the last opponents of the Accelerated Climate Change Model were converted to the cause by the dust storms of 2041.",1
"In short, the world faced many challenges, and by the end of the fifth decade of the current century, public discourse was dominated by a mood of threat and pessimism.",1
"It is, of course, easy to be wise with the benefit of hindsight, but from our vantage point it is now clear that the only thing the population had to fear was fear itself.",1
The true danger humanity faced during this period was the shrinking of its own spirit.,1
EXAMINER: Define spirit.,1
"The Examiner's voice was carefully modulated, the sort of effect that could be achieved with the cheapest of filters.",1
"Only it wasn't technology Anax heard; it was control, pure and simple.",1
"Every pause, every flickering of uncertainty: the Examiners observed them all.",1
"This, surely, was how they decided.",1
Anax felt suddenly slow and unimpressive.,1
She could still hear Pericles' last words.,1
"""They want to see how you will respond to the chal- lenge.",1
Don't hesitate.,1
Talk your way toward understanding.,1
"Trust the words."" And back then it had sounded so simple.",1
"Now her face tautened and she had to think her way to the words, searching for them in the way one searches for a friend in a crowd, panic never more than a moment away.",1
ANAXIMANDER: By spirit I mean to say something about the prevailing mood of the time.,1
Human spirit is the ability to face the uncertainty of the future with curiosity and optimism.,1
"It is the belief that problems can be solved, differences resolved.",1
It is a type of confidence.,1
And it is fragile.,1
"It can be blackened by fear, and superstition.",1
"By the year 2050, when the conflict began, the world had fallen upon fearful, superstitious times.",1
EXAMINER: Tell us more about these superstitions.,1
ANAXIMANDER: Superstition is the need to view the world in terms of simple cause and effect.,1
"As I have already said, religious fundamentalism was on the rise, but that is not the type of superstition I'm referring to.",1
The superstition that held sway at the time was a belief in simple causes.,1
"Even the plainest of events is tied down by a thick tangle of permutation and possibility, but the human mind struggles with such complexity.",1
"In times of trouble, when the belief in simple gods breaks down, a cult of conspiracy arises.",1
So it was back then.,1
"Unable to attribute misfortune to chance, unable to accept their ultimate insignificance within the greater scheme, the people looked for monsters in their midst.",1
"The more the media peddled fear, the more the people lost the ability to believe in one another.",1
"For every new ill that befell them, the media created an explanation, and the explanation always had a face and a name.",1
The people came to fear even their closest neighbors.,1
"At the level of the individual, the community, and the nation, people sought signs of others' ill intentions; and everywhere they looked, they found them, for this is what looking does.",1
This was the true challenge the people of this time faced.,1
The challenge of trusting one another.,1
And they fell short of this challenge.,1
"This is what I mean, when I say they faced a shrinking of the spirit.",1
EXAMINER: Thank you for your clarification.,1
Now please return to your story of the times.,1
How did The Republic come to be established?,1
"Just as Pericles had predicted, Anax was buoyed by the sound of her own voice.",1
This is what made her such a good candidate.,1
"Her thoughts followed her words, or so he explained it.",1
"""Everybody is different, and this is your skill."" So although the story she was telling was a stale one, left too long, examined too often, Anax found herself wrapping it in new words, growing in confidence with every layer.",1
"There had to be a king and queen, of course.",1
"The king was a terrible old man who wore six-shooters and spurs, and shouted in such a tremendous voice that the rattlers on the prairie would run into their holes under the prickly pear.",1
"Before there was a royal family they called the man ""Whispering Ben."" When he came to own 50,000 acres of land and more cattle than he could count, they called him O'Donnell ""the Cattle King.""

The queen had been a Mexican girl from Laredo.",1
"She made a good, mild, Colorado-claro wife, and even succeeded in teaching Ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house to keep the dishes from being broken.",1
When Ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery of Espinosa Ranch and weave rush mats.,1
"When wealth became so irresistible and oppressive that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from San Antone in the wagons, she bowed her smooth, dark head, and shared the fate of the Danae.",1
To avoid lese-majeste you have been presented first to the king and queen.,1
"They do not enter the story, which might be called ""The Chronicle of the Princess, the Happy Thought, and the Lion that Bungled his Job.""

Josefa O'Donnell was the surviving daughter, the princess.",1
"From her mother she inherited warmth of nature and a dusky, semi-tropic beauty.",1
"From Ben O'Donnell the royal she acquired a store of intrepidity, common sense, and the faculty of ruling.",1
The combination was one worth going miles to see.,1
Josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could put five out of six bullets through a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string.,1
"She could play for hours with a white kitten she owned, dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes.",1
"Scorning a pencil, she could tell you out of her head what 1545 two-year-olds would bring on the hoof, at $8.50 per head.",1
"Roughly speaking, the Espinosa Ranch is forty miles long and thirty broad--but mostly leased land.",1
"Josefa, on her pony, had prospected over every mile of it.",1
Every cow-puncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal.,1
"Ripley Givens, foreman of one of the Espinosa outfits, saw her one day, and made up his mind to form a royal matrimonial alliance.",1
Presumptuous?,1
No.,1
In those days in the Nueces country a man was a man.,1
"And, after all, the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty.",1
Often it only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art of cattle stealing.,1
One day Ripley Givens rode over to the Double Elm Ranch to inquire about a bunch of strayed yearlings.,1
"He was late in setting out on his return trip, and it was sundown when he struck the White Horse Crossing of the Nueces.",1
From there to his own camp it was sixteen miles.,1
To the Espinosa ranch it was twelve.,1
Givens was tired.,1
He decided to pass the night at the Crossing.,1
There was a fine water hole in the river-bed.,1
"The banks were thickly covered with great trees, undergrown with brush.",1
Back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly mesquite grass--supper for his horse and bed for himself.,1
"Givens staked his horse, and spread out his saddle blankets to dry.",1
He sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette.,1
"From somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden, rageful, shivering wail.",1
The pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of comprehending fear.,1
"Givens puffed at his cigarette, but he reached leisurely for his pistol-belt, which lay on the grass, and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively.",1
A great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole.,1
A little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at Givens.,1
The pony went on eating grass.,1
It is well to be reasonably watchful when a Mexican lion sings soprano along the arroyos at sundown.,1
"The burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are scarce, and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance.",1
"In the grass lay an empty fruit can, cast there by some former sojourner.",1
Givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction.,1
In his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee.,1
Black coffee and cigarettes!,1
What ranchero could desire more?,1
In two minutes he had a little fire going clearly.,1
"He started, with his can, for the water hole.",1
"When within fifteen yards of its edge he saw, between the bushes, a side-saddled pony with down-dropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left.",1
Just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was Josefa O'Donnell.,1
"She had been drinking water, and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands.",1
"Ten yards away, to her right, half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the Mexican lion.",1
"His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight, like a pointer's.",1
His hind-quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping.,1
Givens did what he could.,1
His six-shooter was thirty-five yards away lying on the grass.,1
"He gave a loud yell, and dashed between the lion and the princess.",1
"The ""rucus,"" as Givens called it afterward, was brief and somewhat confused.",1
"When he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air, and heard a couple of faint cracks.",1
"Then a hundred pounds of Mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him, with a heavy jar, to the ground.",1
"He remembered calling out: ""Let up, now--no fair gouging!"" and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm, with his mouth full of grass and dirt, and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water-elm.",1
The lion lay motionless.,1
"Givens, feeling aggrieved, and suspicious of fouls, shook his fist at the lion, and shouted: ""I'll rastle you again for twenty--"" and then he got back to himself.",1
"Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted .38.",1
It had not been a difficult shot.,1
The lion's head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string.,1
"There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes.",1
The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul.,1
"Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it.",1
"The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter.",1
There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.,1
"""Is that you, Mr.",1
"Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto.",1
"""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled.",1
"Did you hurt your head when you fell?""

""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast.",1
It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect.,1
"Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.",1
"""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.",1
"""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.",1
"""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief.",1
"""Nobody can blame you.",1
"I tried to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""

""Save who?""

""Why, Bill.",1
I've been looking for him all day.,1
"You see, he's been our camp pet for two years.",1
"Poor old fellow, he wouldn't have hurt a cottontail rabbit.",1
It'll break the boys all up when they hear about it.,1
"But you couldn't tell, of course, that Bill was just trying to play with you.""

Josefa's black eyes burned steadily upon him.",1
Ripley Givens met the test successfully.,1
He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively.,1
"In his eye was regret, not unmingled with a gentle reproach.",1
His smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow.,1
Josefa wavered.,1
"""What was your pet doing here?"" she asked, making a last stand.",1
"""There's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.""

""The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,"" answered Givens readily.",1
"""It's a wonder the coyotes didn't scare him to death.",1
"You see, Jim Webster, our horse wrangler, brought a little terrier pup into camp last week.",1
The pup made life miserable for Bill--he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time.,1
Every night when bedtime came Bill would sneak under one of the boy's blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him.,1
I reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn't have run away.,1
"He was always afraid to get out of sight of camp.""

Josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal.",1
Givens gently patted one of the formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow.,1
Slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl.,1
Was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry?,1
"Her eyes grew softer, and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery.",1
"""I'm very sorry,"" she said humbly; ""but he looked so big, and jumped so high that--""

""Poor old Bill was hungry,"" interrupted Givens, in quick defence of the deceased.",1
"""We always made him jump for his supper in camp.",1
He would lie down and roll over for a piece of meat.,1
"When he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you.""

Suddenly Josefa's eyes opened wide.",1
"""I might have shot you!"" she exclaimed.",1
"""You ran right in between.",1
You risked your life to save your pet!,1
"That was fine, Mr.",1
Givens.,1
"I like a man who is kind to animals.""

Yes; there was even admiration in her gaze now.",1
"After all, there was a hero rising out of the ruins of the anti-climax.",1
The look on Givens's face would have secured him a high position in the S.P.C.A.,1
"""I always loved 'em,"" said he; ""horses, dogs, Mexican lions, cows, alligators--""

""I hate alligators,"" instantly demurred Josefa; ""crawly, muddy things!""

""Did I say alligators?"" said Givens.",1
"""I meant antelopes, of course.""

Josefa's conscience drove her to make further amends.",1
She held out her hand penitently.,1
"There was a bright, unshed drop in each of her eyes.",1
"""Please forgive me, Mr.",1
"Givens, won't you?",1
"I'm only a girl, you know, and I was frightened at first.",1
"I'm very, very sorry I shot Bill.",1
You don't know how ashamed I feel.,1
"I wouldn't have done it for anything.""",1
He held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of Bill.,1
At last it was clear that he had forgiven her.,1
"""Please don't speak of it any more, Miss Josefa.",1
Twas enough to frighten any young lady the way Bill looked.,1
"I'll explain it all right to the boys.""",1
"Her eyes were sweet--oh, sweet and pleading with gracious penitence.",1
"""I would hate anyone who would kill my kitten.",1
And how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him!,1
"How very few men would have done that!"" Victory wrested from defeat!",1
Vaudeville turned into drama!,1
"Bravo, Ripley Givens!",1
It was now twilight.,1
Of course Miss Josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the ranch-house alone.,1
"Givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal's reproachful glances, and rode with her.",1
"Side by side they galloped across the smooth grass, the princess and the man who was kind to animals.",1
The prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them.,1
Coyotes yelping over there on the hill!,1
No fear.,1
And yet-- Josefa rode closer.,1
A little hand seemed to grope.,1
Givens found it with his own.,1
The ponies kept an even gait.,1
"The hands lingered together, and the owner of one explained:

""I never was frightened before, but just think!",1
How terrible it would be to meet a really wild lion!,1
Poor Bill!,1
"I'm so glad you came with me!""",1
"""Hello, Rip!"" he shouted--""that you?""",1
"""I lost my way and was late.""",1
"""Stop over, Rip, and ride to camp in the morning.""

But Givens would not.",1
He would push on to camp.,1
There was a bunch of steers to start off on the trail at daybreak.,1
"He said good-night, and trotted away.",1
"An hour later, when the lights were out, Josefa, in her night-robe, came to her door and called to the king in his own room across the brick-paved hallway:

""Say, pop, you know that old Mexican lion they call the 'Gotch-eared Devil'--the one that killed Gonzales, Mr.",1
"Martin's sheep herder, and about fifty calves on the Salado range?",1
"Well, I settled his hash this afternoon over at the White Horse Crossing.",1
Put two balls in his head with my .38 while he was on the jump.,1
I knew him by the slice gone from his left ear that old Gonzales cut off with his machete.,1
"You couldn't have made a better shot yourself, daddy.""

""Bully for you!"" thundered Whispering Ben from the darkness of the royal chamber.",1
O'Donnell was sitting on the ranch gallery.,1
"Much obliged, called the cattle king.",1
"He rode in with me, said Josefa.",1
Are you really sure you don't hate me? ,1
Givens took the proffered hand.,1
Josefa came closer to him impulsively.,1
At midnight the cafe was crowded.,1
"By some chance the little table at which I sat had escaped the eye of incomers, and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons.",1
"And then a cosmopolite sat in one of them, and I was glad, for I held a theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has existed.",1
"We hear of them, and we see foreign labels on much luggage, but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites.",1
"I invoke your consideration of the scene--the marble-topped tables, the range of leather-upholstered wall seats, the gay company, the ladies dressed in demi-state toilets, speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste, economy, opulence or art; the sedulous and largess-loving garcons, the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers; the melange of talk and laughter--and, if you will, the Wurzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay.",1
I was told by a sculptor from Mauch Chunk that the scene was truly Parisian.,1
My cosmopolite was named E.,1
"Rushmore Coglan, and he will be heard from next summer at Coney Island.",1
"He is to establish a new ""attraction"" there, he informed me, offering kingly diversion.",1
And then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude.,1
"He took the great, round world in his hand, so to speak, familiarly, contemptuously, and it seemed no larger than the seed of a Maraschino cherry in a table d'hote grape fruit.",1
"He spoke disrespectfully of the equator, he skipped from continent to continent, he derided the zones, he mopped up the high seas with his napkin.",1
With a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in Hyderabad.,1
Whiff!,1
He would have you on skis in Lapland.,1
Zip!,1
Now you rode the breakers with the Kanakas at Kealaikahiki.,1
Presto!,1
"He dragged you through an Arkansas post-oak swamp, let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his Idaho ranch, then whirled you into the society of Viennese archdukes.",1
Anon he would be telling you of a cold he acquired in a Chicago lake breeze and how old Escamila cured it in Buenos Ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed.,1
"You would have addressed a letter to ""E.",1
"Rushmore Coglan, Esq., the Earth, Solar System, the Universe,"" and have mailed it, feeling confident that it would be delivered to him.",1
"""She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,"" cried the young Student; ""but in all my garden there is no red rose.""

"""No red rose in all my garden!"" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.",1
"""Ah, fon what little things does happiness depend!",1
"I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.""

""Here at last is a true lover,"" said the Nightingale.",1
"""Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.",1
"His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.""

""The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,"" murmured the young Student, ""and my love will be of the company.",1
If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.,1
"If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.",1
"But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.",1
"She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.""

"It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.""",1
IN GILT letters on the ground glass of the door of room No.,1
"962 were the words: ""Robbins & Hartley, Brokers."" The clerks had gone.",1
"It was past five, and with the solid tramp of a drove of prize Percherons, scrub-women were invading the cloud-capped twenty-story office building.",1
"A puff of red-hot air flavoured with lemon peelings, soft-coal smoke and train oil came in through the half-open windows.",1
"Robbins, fifty, something of an overweight beau, and addicted to first nights and hotel palm-rooms, pretended to be envious of his partner's commuter's joys.",1
"""Going to be something doing in the humidity line to-night,"" he said.",1
"""You out-of-town chaps will be the people, with your katydids and moonlight and long drinks and things out on the front porch.""

Hartley, twenty-nine, serious, thin, good-looking, nevous, sighed and frowned a little.",1
"""Yes,"" said he, ""we always have cool nights in Floralhurst, especially in the winter.""

A man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to Hartley.",1
"""I've found where she lives,"" he announced in the portentous half-whisper that makes the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men.",1
Hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude.,1
"But by that time Robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking, and with a debonair nod went out to his metropolitan amusements.",1
"""Here is the address,"" said the detective in a natural tone, being deprived of an audience to foil.",1
Hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth's dingy memorandum book.,1
"On it were pencilled the words ""Vivienne Arlington, No.",1
"341 East --th Street, care of Mrs.",1
"McComus.""",1
"""Now, if you want any shadowing done, Mr.",1

Then he left the office and boarded a Broadway car.,1
"At the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue, whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the town.",1
"Walking a few squares, he came to the building that he sought.",1
"It was a new flathouse, bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name, ""The Vallambrosa."" Fire-escapes zigzagged down its front -- these laden with household goods, drying clothes, and squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat.",1
"Here and there a pale rubber plant peeped from the miscellaneous mass, as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged -- vegetable, animal or artificial.",1
"Hartley pressed the ""McComus"" button.",1
"The door latch clicked spasmodically -- now hospitably, now doubtfully, as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns.",1
"Hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who seek their friends in city flat-houses -- which is the manner of a boy who climbs an apple-tree, stopping when he comes upon what he wants.",1
On the fourth floor he saw Vivienne standing in an open door.,1
"She invited him inside, with a nod and a bright, genuine smile.",1
"She placed a chair for him near a window, and poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those Jekyll-and-Hyde pieces of furniture that are masked and mysteriously hooded, unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks of torture by night.",1
"Moved there a week ago, said the detective.",1
" ""One day's work,"" said the sleuth.",1
Hartley paid the man and dismissed him.,1

"The most salient new sound in recent years is hyperpop, a dizzyingly hooky, wildly referential microgenre that has been described by one of SpotifyÕs influential Òdata alchemistsÓ as Òebullient electro-maximalism.Ó",1
Call it a vibe shift if you must.,1
"Certainly, there is a youthful element to this bad-taste renaissance.",1
"Trendspotters have glommed on to the Y2K nostalgia and end-times decadence in Gen ZÕs nascent aesthetic sensibility (see: the skimpy, iridescent fashions of Euphoria).",1
"But what weÕre witnessing goes far beyond cool teens and the extremely online to encompass anyone with free time, disposable income, and internet access.",1
What weÕre dealing with is a full-blown cultural moment.,1
"The 20-year nostalgia cycle, climate-change nihilism, information saturation, streaming-era content overload, and our collective Long COVID of the soul have converged in a tidal wave of tackiness.",1
"What TikTok teens, white collar workers marooned in home offices, and the gatekept super-rich all have in common is the kind of physical isolation, if not the sense of doom, that makes a person desperate just to feel something.",1
"And nothing kills numbness like a sensory onslaughtÑcolor, sound, hedonism, melodrama, sleaze.",1
"Yet whatÕs remarkable about this particular pendulum swing is that after centuries of wrestling with hierarchies of taste, the cultural stigma that has always come with indulging in bad taste has disappeared.Bad taste can be tough to define, because standards are changing all the time.",1
"For women in the Victorian era, wearing makeup was considered cheap.",1
Rock snobbery wouldÕve baffled 1950s parents scandalized by ElvisÕ hips.,1

"We have entered an era of exuberant, even apocalyptic, bad taste.",1
"Nestled in the scenic Venango County of northwestern Pennsylvania, Titusville is a small town with a monumental legacy.",1
"It is here, along the banks of Oil Creek, that the first commercial oil well was drilled in 1859 by Edwin L.",1
"Drake, forever changing the course of energy history.",1
"The Drake Well Museum, located 3 miles south of Titusville, stands as a testament to this groundbreaking achievement.",1
"For professionals in the energy sector, a visit to this museum is not just a trip down memory lane but an essential pilgrimage to understand the roots of modern energy production.",1
"Titusville is situated in a region rich with natural oil seeps, which had been known to Native Americans for centuries.",1
"The indigenous people used the petroleum collected from surface seeps for medicinal purposes, recognizing its healing properties long before the advent of modern medicine.",1
"The areaÕs geological features made it an ideal location for oil extraction, with oil trapped in sandstone reservoirs beneath the surface.",1
"Before the dawn of commercial oil and gas exploration, the world in 1859 was vastly different.",1
"The global population was around 1 billion, with most people living in energy poverty and a life expectancy of less than 40 years.",1
"The US had been independent for more than 80 years, and Britain was burning coal, wood, and anything flammable to fuel the Industrial Revolution.",1
"Coal was the dominant source of energy, powering factories, trains, and heating homes.",1
"However, for lighting, whale oil was the primary source.",1
"Whale oil, particularly from sperm whales, produced a clean, bright flame and was highly sought after.",1
"This demand led to the near extinction of the whale population, making whale oil increasingly scarce and expensive.",1
"Many families struggled to afford lighting, plunging them into darkness as prices soared.",1
"The story of the Drake Well begins in the mid-1850s when George Bissell and other East Coast speculators formed the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company, later known as Seneca Oil Company when reorganized by James Townsend.",1
They believed that oil could be extracted from the ground using drilling techniques similar to those used for salt wells.,1
"Drake, a former railroad conductor, was hired to oversee the drilling operations in Titusville.",1
"Despite having no prior experience in drilling, DrakeÕs determination and innovative thinking led to a historic breakthrough.",1
"He hired Uncle Billy Smith, a salt driller, to manage the operations.",1
The museum features an engine house and oil derrick on site.,1
"Drake faced numerous challenges, including the collapse of the well walls due to groundwater seepage.",1
"To overcome this, he devised a method of driving a cast iron pipe into the ground to stabilize the wellbore.",1
"On 27 August 1859, after drilling to a depth of 69.5 ft, Drake struck oil.",1
"This well, known as Drake Well, produced approximately 20 BOPD initially, marking the birth of the modern petroleum industry.",1
DrakeÕs successful drilling operation had far-reaching implications.,1
"It provided a new, abundant, and cheaper source of energy that quickly replaced whale oil for lighting.",1
This shift not only saved the whale population but also made lighting affordable for many households.,1
"The availability of petroleum spurred further investment in oil drilling, refining, and marketing, laying the foundation for the global oil industry we know today.",1
"Cities sprang up around new oil discoveries, with many wildcatters testing their luck.",1
"While some towns thrived, others became ghost towns.",1
Unregulated drilling left behind orphaned wells.,1
"Over time, significant advancements were made in safety, regulation, and technology.",1
"Today, the world consumes over 100 million BOPD, along with substantial amounts of natural gas.",1
"Energy is essential for modern life, and hydrocarbons play a crucial role in providing a comfortable standard of living.",1
"Society has evolved significantly thanks to DrakeÕs entrepreneurial spirit, with life expectancy nearly doubling due to a more energized world.",1
Visiting the Drake Well Museum offers a comprehensive look at the early days of the oil industry.,1
"The museum features a replica of the original Drake Well, complete with an engine house and derrick.",1
"Exhibits include historical artifacts, photographs, and interactive displays that bring the story of DrakeÕs pioneering efforts to life.",1
"The museum also highlights the broader impact of the oil industry on society, technology, and the environment.",1
The museum features a full-size replica of Drake's engine house originally built in 1845.,1
"For energy professionals, the Drake Well Museum is more than just a historical site; it is a place of inspiration and reflection.",1
Understanding the challenges and triumphs of early oil exploration provides valuable insights into the evolution of energy production and the ongoing quest for sustainable energy solutions.,1
"By visiting the birthplace of the modern oil industry, professionals can gain a deeper appreciation for the innovations that have shaped our world and continue to drive progress in the energy sector.",1
"The North Sea sits between Great Britain, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France in the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 1).",1
"It has long hosted key northern European shipping lanes, provides a major fishery, and more recently, serves as a growing source of renewable wind and wave power.",1
It is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries.,1
It has also been one of EuropeÕs most important sources of oil and natural gas since the discovery of its offshore reservoirs in the late 1950s and early 1960s.,1
The first discoveries of oil and gas in the North Sea occurred on shore in the second half of the 1800s and the early 1900s.,1
"The first discovery of gas in quantity, also on shore, occurred in 1959 in what later became known as the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands.",1
Deepwater exploration was only made possible in 1964 by the Convention on the Continental Shelf.,1
"This UN measure gave countries with coastlines sovereignty over the continental shelves and their associated natural resources off their shores, something that had been previously limited by international law.",1
The countries with coasts on the North Sea received an exclusive economic zone in which they could license development of any natural resources found.,1
The first offshore discovery of gas in the North Sea was made by BPÕs Sea Gem in the West Sole field in September 1965 with subsequent gas discoveries coming thick and fast.,1
"The Sea Gem capsized only a few months after this initial discovery, a harbinger of the challenging conditions operations in the North Sea would face.",1
Oil was not discovered offshore until 1969 when Phillips Petroleum drilled a successful well in what later became known as the Ekofisk field in the Norwegian sector.,1
"Subsequent development in the North Sea was galvanized by oil crises in 1973 and 1979, both of which drove up oil prices and improved the economics of the North Sea.",1
"Today, there are hundreds of known oil and gas fields in the North Sea (Fig. 2), including the eponymousBrent field, discovered in 1971, which lent its name to the benchmark Brent crude (although today the benchmark is a blend of crudes from the North Sea).",1
The vast majority of North Sea reserves fell under the jurisdictions of the UK and Norway.,1
"Consequently, these two countries also account for the majority of production in the North Sea.",1
Oil production peaked in the late 90s at just over 6 million B/D (Fig. 3).,1
"Production has been falling relatively steadily since, and, after oil and gas demand was battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, reached lows not seen since its inception.",1
"However, despite being in what might be a terminal decline, the North Sea has had a significant impact over the past 50+ years.",1
"In Norway, which exports roughly 90% of its production, the impact has been even larger.",1
"Over its lifetime, the North Sea has contributed approximately NOK 16.5 trillion ($1.82 trillion at the time of writing) in todayÕs NOK to the economy.",1
"In 2021 alone, it made up 20% of GDP, 20% of government revenues, 20% of investments, and 50% of total exports (Fig. 4).",1
"Over the lifetime of the North Sea, its production has consistently accounted for 10Ð30% of each of these figures (Fig. 5).",1
"This revenue allowed Norway to create the Government Pension Fund of Norway, or, simply, Òthe Fund,Ó which it has been able to use to smooth government income and provide generous social services despite the fluctuation in oil prices.",1
The Fund is worth around NOK 11.5 trillion and is one of the worldÕs largest sovereign wealth funds.,1
"In addition to its raw economic heft, the North Sea, by virtue of being renowned as one of the most inhospitable locations for oil and gas operations, demanded innovation in offshore operations.",1
"Design solutions like steel jackets, concrete gravity platforms, tethered semisubmersibles, tension-leg platforms, and underwater manifold systems are all products of North Sea innovation.",1
The chop in the surrounding seas made tanker loading difficult and necessitated a way to temporarily store significant amounts of oil at sea.,1
This in turn gave birth to the CondeepÑa giant concrete-reinforced production platform with huge storage tanksÑpatented and developed in Norway in 1972.,1
"In a somewhat ironic twist, some of these innovations are now used to form the base for offshore wind facilities destined for the North Sea.",1
"While spurring technical innovations, these conditions have also been party to a number of tragedies, beginning with the capsizing of the Sea Gem and including one of the worst oilfield disasters in historyÑthe Piper Alpha.",1
These tragedies resulted in step changes in safety and spurred developments in offshore safety that are still in force today.,1
Consistent production declines have been matched by a drop in exploration activities.,1
"In the mid-2010s, plug and abandonment (P&A) activity began to exceed exploration and production (E&P) activity (Fig. 6).",1
Decommissioning will involve hundreds of wells and billions of dollars over many years.,1
"A combination of dwindling discoveries, increasing costs, the price crash of 2014Ð2016, and a strong European push to phase out petroleum-based energy sources has created a business climate as inhospitable as the North Sea itself.",1
"Although recent underinvestment in the E&P sector and concerns about supply stability due to geopolitical turmoil have driven oil and gas prices near 10-year highs, the most this is likely to offer by way of respite is a delay in the decommissioning timelines: North Sea conventional wells costs are high, and technically complex offshore projects are often developed on timelines that are measured in decades.",1
"Even if current elevated prices were to last for years, the combination of extended time horizons, costly projects, and an unfavorable regulatory environment mean the North Sea is not situated to act as a swing producerÑOPEC and AmericaÕs frackers now compete for that crown.",1
"While engineers who thrive on the complexities of deepwater development may bemoan the decrease in such opportunities, it is also a testament to the prowess of the industry.",1
"Technical progression has made previously uneconomic onshore shale reserves more accessible, driving down prices and turning expensive offshore developments into a luxury, not a necessity.",1
"The engineering wheel never stops turning, however, and it may one day come to pass that, even with a heavy regulatory burden, new technology makes even the most daunting of offshore operations look economically feasible again.",1
"Even if such a development does not come to pass, the North Sea should still be remembered for its role as a critical resource during the oil crises of the 1970s, an economic boon for the UK and Norway, and an inspiration for technical developments that are still in use around the world today, both within and outside of the industry.",1
Qatar is a desert peninsula in eastern Arabia with Saudi Arabia on its south and the remainder surrounded by the Persian Gulf (Fig. 1).,1
The peninsula is small Ñonly 100 miles (160 km) from north to southÑand 50 miles (80 km) from east to west.,1
"It plays home to a population of just under 3 million, of which approximately 10Ð15% are Qataris.",1
"Despite its small size and population, Qatar wields an outsized influence on the world stage as a direct consequence of its status as the worldÕs largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter.",1
"Before discovering oil and gas within its borders, QatarÕs population was one of the poorest in the world.",1
"Pearling, fishing, and trade were the main ways to make a living.",1
Oil was first discovered in the Dukhan Field in 1940.,1
"Although further exploration and development was delayed by World War II, this discovery was the first step in transforming the state's economy.",1
"As reserves are exploited, native Qataris have been able to enjoy one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world; rising from $2,755 in 1970, GDP per capita reached $85,000 in the mid-2010s, although it had fallen back to $50,000 when last reported by the IMF in 2020 (Fig. 2).",1
"While initial development of oil and gas discoveries was conducted by concessionaries, such as the Iraq Petroleum Company, a consortium of European and American firms, oil and gas production was nationalized in a series of steps in the 1970s.",1
"Full nationalization occurred in 1977 and former concessionaries were instead granted services contracts, with operations overseen by Qatar Petroleum (now QatarEnergy), the national oil company.",1
"Today, QatarÕs oil reserves are modest by regional standards at 25 billion barrels.",1
This puts it ninth in OPEC and 13th in the world for reserves.,1
"Its oil production is similarly modest at 843,000 B/D.",1
"What it lacks in potential as an oil powerhouse, Qatar has more than made up for with enormous deposits of natural gas.",1
"The offshore North Field, first tapped in 1971, while not the first discovery of gas in Qatar, has turned out to be one of the largest gas fields in the world.",1
"Spanning an area roughly equivalent to Qatar itself, it holds an estimated 10% of the worldÕs reserves (Fig. 3).",1
"Qatar aggressively pursued a strategy of developing its natural gas reserves through joint projects with major international oil and gas companies, focusing on the North Field.",1
"Today, Qatar boasts 891 Tcf of natural gas reserves and produces 16.5 Bcf/D, ranking it third in the world behind only Russia and Iran (Fig. 4).",1
"With a small population limiting domestic demand for natural gas, fully utilizing the potential of the massive reserves in the North Field necessitated the ability to export natural gas.",1
"To this effect, Qatargas was established in 1984 as a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and various other international oil companies including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Total to develop liquefaction and export capacity.",1
"In 1996, Qatar exported its first LNG shipment to Japan.",1
"As additional capacity came on line, Qatargas added customers, including Spain, South Korea, and India.",1
"By 2006, just 10 years after its first export, Qatar overtook Malaysia as the worldÕs largest LNG exporter.",1
"In the first decade of the 21st century, natural gas surpassed oil as the largest share of the governmentÕs revenues and the countryÕs GDP.",1
"Today, the natural-gas-focused strategy continues to pay dividends: Qatargas operates 14 LNG trains and a fleet of 25 tankers, which it uses to export approximately 70% to a customer base of more than 25 countries under the aegis of Qatargas.",1
"Since the turn of the century, Qatar has notched up soft-power victories including hosting the 2006 Asian Games, winning the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and acting as mediator in high-profile disputes.",1
A contributing factor to these is QatarÕs ability to leverage its economic success.,1
"Domestically, its vast wealth has been used to great effect.",1
Such events attract international attention and provides ample opportunities for developing connections.,1
"Another part of this strategy is support of the state-owned Qatar Airways, which funnels international travelers through its hub in Doha, further increasing QatarÕs visibility (and ensuring attendees have a way to get to Doha).",1
"Qatar has leveraged its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), to raise its profile.",1
"As part of the Qatar National Vision 2030, it seeks to diversify its economy in such a way to sustain its economic success and sociopolitical stability without relying only on LNG exports.",1
"The QIA has also made high-profile investments including in European football clubs, banks, and car markets, promoting the countryÕs branding.",1
"Qatar is an example of how the prudent management of a small nationÕs natural resources can lay a foundation for economic prosperity, international recognition, and influence for itself and its citizens.",1
The country's wealth has enabled the hosting of prestigious international events by enabling the construction of the venues necessary to host them without incurring serious financial hardship or the public backlash that such costs might elicit from a tax-paying citizenry.,1
"Sustainable investing has been on a tear since the first green bond was issued by the European Investment Bank in 2007, lately becoming a buzzword in financial markets in recent years.",1
"At the end of 2020, sustainable investment accounted for $17.1 trillion (roughly one third) of $51.4 trillion total managed assets in the US (Fig. 1).",1
The global trend is similar and is forecast to continue well into the future (Fig. 2).,1
"Sustainable investing has various definitions depending on who is asked, but BlackRock, currently the largest asset manager in the world, defines it as Òa range of strategies that combine traditional investment approaches with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) insights to seek to deliver both financial and purpose-driven outcomes.Ó At the top of the list of ESG considerations encompassed by sustainable investing are environment-related themes like climate change, global warming, and plastic reduction.",1
"Other themes garnering interest include community development, multicultural/gender diversity, and sustainable development goals.",1
"If the raw dollar amount is not convincing enough, surveys of investor sentiment also indicated a growing trend.",1
Survey data from Morgan Stanley show the increase in the number of participants that are Òvery interestedÓ in sustainability investing to be up from 19% in 2015 to 49% in 2019.,1
"Among millennials, the numbers are significantly higher (Fig. 3).",1
Sustainable investing is available to investors in a variety of forms and vehicles.,1
"Broadly speaking, they can be sorted into three categories.",1
Green equities are perhaps the simplest and most direct method of green investment for an individual or institution.,1
An investor picks a publicly traded company believed to be ÒgreenÓ and purchases some of the companyÕs shares.,1
This approach has the advantage of being direct and does not leave any question as to who or what an individualÕs money supports.,1
It does rest on the assumption that public statements made by the company are accurate.,1
"This has generally been a safe assumption due to rules enforced by market regulators, but not a bulletproof one as evidenced by various corporate scandals such as Enron and Theranos.",1
Mutual Funds/Exchange Traded Funds.,1
Mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) represent share in the ownership of a portfolio managed by a third party (and investment or portfolio manager).,1
"Often created with a theme in mind (such as tracking the S&P 500 or, in this case, investing in green companies) these vehicles offer the private investor a way to outsource much of the research burden that would otherwise be associated with picking individual stocks.",1
The portfolio manager (an individual or team) selects companies in which to invest based on their business prospects as well as whether they align with the stated goal of the fund.,1
Investment funds make it easy to diversify investments at a relatively low cost.,1
"However, when it comes to green funds, the lack of existing definitions or regulations surrounding them demand extra vigilance on the part of private investors, requiring research into the fundÕs holdings to determine whether they align with its (and the investorÕs) stated mission.",1
A bond is a loan made by an investor to a company (or government) at a specified interest rate and maturity date.,1
A green bond differs from a traditional bond primarily in that the capital raised by a green bond must be spent on environmentally friendly projects.,1
"The prospects of financial success from pursuing sustainable investment strategies, while not guaranteed, seem probable.",1
"In 2020, the S&P Clean Energy Index heartily outperformed the S&P 500 (Fig. 4).",1
This can be attributed to two factors.,1
"First, supply and demandÑmore money chasing a limited asset pool will drive up prices.",1
"Second, the idea that a company or fundÕs value on the market should reflect its expected future earnings.",1
"A rising value suggests that the company or fundÕs future earnings will perform better in a warming, decarbonizing, and/or electrifying world.",1
The flip side of this is that companies and funds out of vogue see their market value suffer as investors sell their stake in these companies to chase what they believe to be greener (pun not intended) pastures.,1
"This trend has been acutely felt across the oil and gas industry, with the upstream sector facing the most scrutiny for its perceived impact on the environment.",1
"Abandoning investment in traditional energy companies in favor of those perceived to be ÒgreenerÓ is, for a variety of reasons, a mistake, largely attributable to an inaccurate perception of the industry.",1
The first reason for this is a lack of concrete metrics by which to evaluate an investment on the grounds of sustainability.,1
"An investment survey carried out by Pitchbook in 2020 revealed that the top sources of information on sustainable investing were webinars/conferences, white papers/case studies and sustainable investment organizations among others.",1
Another study done by Schroders revealed that a plurality of the surveyed participants (34%) would only have full confidence in the sustainability prospects of a company if it were endorsed by an independent third party.,1
"Investors endorsed sustainability-related groups like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Principles for Responsible Investment, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures among others (Fig. 5).",1
"The absence of a common standard, in combination with its newness and voluntary nature, has led to significant variation in the measurement and reporting of ESG metrics.",1
"Some of the top organizations helping with reporting frameworks and guidance are the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.",1
"Others include the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, and the American Petroleum InstituteÑwho jointly developed industry-specific guidance for sustainability reporting.",1
This guidance takes some of its inspiration from the GRI framework.,1
Each framework has a slightly different focus.,1
"Despite sharing an overarching goal, the varied nature of these numerous frameworks and the absence of a globally recognized set of ESG metrics has made it a challenge to sort through and compare results among companies.",1
"Without an officially verified or enforced metric, the door is also open for Ògreenwashing"" or Òthe practice of governments and companies misrepresenting environmental benefits to seduce ethical investors.Ó Greenwashing uses marketing spin to take advantage of the surging demand for sustainable investment products.",1
This makes things even more difficult for the values-driven investor to authenticate claims of credentials or the price to emissions value of an investment.,1
This in turn makes it more difficult for the companies who are trying to prove their commitment to sustainable causes and possess the mettle for innovation to access sorely needed capital.,1
"Among other solutions, improved disclosures would help alleviate the problem of asymmetric information that creates this market inefficiency.",1
"However, this would not fully solve the problems with sustainable investing: There is evidence to suggest that there may be a disconnect between the current ESG reporting and innovation for sustainability.",1
A paper published by the European Corporate Governance Institute explores this thesis.,1
"Their work finds that much of the leading green innovation and resulting patents (between 2008 and 2017) are not driven by the firms with high ESG ratings, commonly favored by ESG funds, but instead by traditional energy sector firms that are excluded, whether implicitly or explicitly, from this investment sphere.",1
The green patents of these firms are also of significantly higher quality than those held by higher-rated ESG firms.,1
The paper also demonstrated that the creation of green patents by traditional energy sector firms is hardly new.,1
An example of that is the fact that one of the most important and foundational patents in solar technology was filed by filed by Exxon in 1978.,1
This suggests that there exists a negative perception gap between ESG reporting metrics and the reality of what (and who) has been driving high-impact sustainable innovation.,1
"Finally, natural gas is the transition fuel of choice, allowing electricity generation to move away from energy sources with greater environmental impact, such as coal, while building renewable capacity.",1
"Without a boom in nuclear power, natural gas is also well positioned to remain the backup generation fuel of choice for when the sun is not shining, or the wind is not blowing.",1
The recent spike in global gas prices due to an impending global shortage during the Northern hemisphereÕs winter is a testament to its continued importance in the global energy makeup.,1
"As the trend towards sustainable investing continues to grow and evolve, it poses a challenge to traditional energy sector firms to become proactive about addressing how their work and its impact are perceived by both the public and the markets.",1
"Poorly formulated metrics would continue to exclude incumbent oil and gas companies, whose established infrastructure and energy expertise will be invaluable in any energy transition, from traditional sources of funding.",1
This perception battle is critical as it is already governing access to billions of dollars of capital.,1
That in turn could ultimately decide who wins or loses in the market.,1
"If approached correctly, sustainable investing presents an opportunity for oil and gas companies to map a realistic road forward.",1
"This should not be a stretch given the amount of energy innovation, past and present, and the social impact the industry has and continues to contribute to the communities they operate in.",1
Traditional energy firms need to engage more with all stakeholders to help standardize ESG reporting for transparency and clarity in a manner that will accurately capture the value that the industry has brought and continues to bring to the quest for a sustainable and energy abundant future.,1
"Properly managed, such a course will, at the same time improve the perception of the industry in the eyes of both the public and the market, maintaining access to channels of funding that will be critical if they are to continue to be pioneers in any energy transition.",1
The heyday of Texas oil made a number of menÑand their familiesÑwealthy.,1
This group of nouveau riche made national headlines with their lavish spending and eccentricities; whether it was the parties thrown by Glenn McCarthy at his Shamrock Hotel in Houston or the Hunt BrothersÕ disastrous attempt to corner the silver market.,1
"By these standards, the separate quests by the sons of two of these familiesÑLamar Hunt (son of H.L.",1
"Hunt, founder of Hunt Oil) and Clint Murchison Jr.",1
"(son of Clint Murchison Sr., wildcatter, founder of the Southern Union Gas Company and businessman) to bring a professional football team back to Texas were downright mundane, not to mention wildly more successful.",1
They also ultimately shaped the NFL as it is known today.,1
"The first professional football team in Texas, the Dallas Texans, played a single dismal season in 1952 before being sold and subsequently disbanded.",1
"A lifelong football nut, Murchison attemptedÑunsuccessfullyÑto buy the ill-fated Texans before they departed spent.",1
He would spend the better part of the next decade attempting to return professional football to Texas.,1
In subsequent years he failed to buy the San Francisco 49ers and reportedly came within a whisper of closing a deal to buy the Washington Redskins before that too fell through.,1
Murchison never succeeded in buying an NFL team.,1
"However, some might argue he did one better; in 1959 he won the right to one of the NFLÕs two expansion franchises, slated to start play in the 1961 season.",1
"Thus, the Dallas Cowboys were born.",1
"That same year, Hunt also succeeded in acquiring his own professional football franchise.",1
"It was not, however, an NFL team.",1
"Like Murchison, HuntÕs initial attempts at acquiring a professional football team for DallasÑspurred by watching the 1958 NFL Championship GameÑwere unsuccessful.",1
In 1958 he failed to secure an expansion franchise and in 1959 he failed to purchase the Chicago Cardinals.,1
"Upon hearing that Murchison was on the verge of securing an NFL franchise of his own for Dallas, Hunt realized that it was unlikely he would be able to secure a second team for Dallas.",1
Following a conversation with Houston oilman Bud Adams (who had also tried (and failed) to secure the Cardinals franchise for Houston) Hunt came up with a solution.,1
"In August of 1959, Hunt announced that he and Adams were founding the American Football League (AFL).",1
"Along with their franchises (the Dallas Texans and Houston Oilers), the duo fleshed out their roster by pursuing others who had expressed interest in the Chicago Cardinals or otherwise failed to secure an NFL franchise of their own.",1
"This provided them with six other teams in New York, Los Angeles, Denver, and Oakland.",1
"The NFL made a last-minute effort to kill the AFL before it ever saw play by offering Hunt a stake in the Cowboys, but he declined.",1
The AFL started playing in 1960.,1
This spurred the NFL to start the Dallas Cowboys a year earlier than initially planned.,1
Both the Texans and the Cowboys played their first seasons in 1960.,1
"Despite the effort, money and enthusiasm their new owners poured into securing their teams, neither the Cowboys nor the Texans managed to draw large crowdsÑDallas simply couldnÕt support two teams.",1
"The Cowboys lost every game but one (which was a tie) in their first season, and the Texans werenÕt in the NFL, despite sporting more on field success.",1
Hunt was reportedly losing $1 million a year.,1
"Despite his fatherÕs quip that at that rate, he could go on losing for another 150 years before going broke, Hunt threw in the towel after the 1962 season and relocated his franchise to Kansas City, rechristening it the Chiefs in the process.",1
"Relieved of the competition and beginning to find success of their own on the field, the Cowboys began to fare better.",1
"Hunt, for his part, secured the future of his franchise and the AFL by securing a first-of-its-kind, $36 million, 5-year television contract.",1
The competition between Cowboys and the Texans was just a small part of the larger competition between the NFL and AFL.,1
"They were natural and immediate rivals, competing for both fans and talent in a Òfinancial bloodbath for both leagues.Ó When the unspoken agreement to not sign one anotherÕs players was broken in 1966, the prospect of even more expensive bidding wars for talent spurred merger talks.",1
"Announced in 1966 and fully executed by 1970, the NFL-AFL merger set the stage for modern day football.",1
"All AFL franchises would continue to exist in their current home cities, the league would expand to 28 teams by 1970, and beginning in 1967 the two leagues would participate in a mutual draft as well as play a championship game at the end of the year.",1
"In its inaugural season, many names were suggested for the championship game including the ÒBig OneÓ and ÒPro Bowl.Ó Its first two iterations were officially called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game.",1
"HuntÑwhoÕs own Kansas City Chiefs played in the inaugural championship gameÑgave an interview in which he referred to it as Òthe Super Bowl,Ó a term whose inspiration he credits to his sonÕs ÒSuper BallÓ toy.",1
The media ran with it.,1
"By the third seasonÕs championship game in 1969, the official name was changed to the Super Bowl.",1
"In 1970, HuntÕs Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings to win Super Bowl IV.",1
They would have to wait another 50 years to win it again.,1
"Our aim was to assess how pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic (pre-pregnancy) hypertension, compared to no hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, impact development of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in type 1 diabetes (T1D).",1
"We included 190 T1D women with median age of 29.4 (interquartile range 26.0Ð33.3) years at delivery between 1988 and 1994 at the Helsinki University Hospital, and who were later re-examined within the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study.",1
"Of these, 43 (22.6%) had had pre-eclampsia, 32 (16.8%) gestational hypertension, 20 (10.5%) chronic hypertension, and 95 (50.0%) had remained normotensive during the index pregnancy.",1
We retrieved follow-up data on cardiovascular events and mortality from national registries until the end of 2020.,1
"During a median 27.9 (25.4Ð30.7) years of follow-up, 46 (24.2%) experienced a composite cardiovascular event and 25 (13.2%) died from any cause.",1
"In Cox regression analysis, the risk of a cardiovascular event was increased for chronic hypertension [hazard ratio, HR 3.45 (95% CI 1.25Ð9.54)], gestational hypertension [HR 3.63 (1.55Ð8.51)], and pre-eclampsia [HR 5.07 (2.31Ð11.11)] compared with the non-hypertension group, after adjustment for delivery age and age at T1D onset.",1
"The corresponding risk of all-cause mortality was increased for chronic hypertension [HR 3.31 (1.06Ð10.35)] and pre-eclampsia [HR 2.92 (1.07Ð7.98)], but not for gestational hypertension [HR 1.26 (0.33Ð4.85)].",1
"After further adjustment for diabetic kidney disease or diabetic retinopathy as a time-dependent covariate, the association with cardiovascular disease remained for pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, while for mortality, none of the associations were significant.",1
"Hypertension during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up in women with T1D, with pre-eclampsia conferring the highest risk.",1
"For all-cause mortality, chronic hypertension and pre-eclampsia, but not gestational hypertension, increases the risk of death, yet not independently of diabetic kidney disease.",1
What is currently known about this topic?,1
Type 1 diabetes and hypertensive pregnancy disorders are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease.,1
Does hypertensive pregnancy disorders in women with type 1 diabetes increase the future risk of cardiovascular disease or mortality.,1
The study highlights the importance of obstetric history when assessing the cardiovascular risk in women with type 1 diabetes.,1
"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the risk being fivefold compared to the general population [1], with indications of a causal relationship [2].",1
"In women with T1D, the CVD risk is especially high, with no risk reduction observed in pre-menopause, as opposed to that observed in the general population [1].",1
"Also, during pregnancy, women with T1D are at high risk of vascular disorders, such as chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia [3, 4].",1
"In T1D, hypertension occurs in 40% of pregnancies [5] and the risk of pre-eclampsia is fourfold compared to women without diabetes [6].",1
"Identified risk factors for hypertensive disorders during T1D pregnancy include poor glycemic control [3, 7], first trimester hypertension, and presence of diabetic microvascular complications [3, 4, 8].",1
Pregnancy is said to offer a window to womenÕs future health.,1
"Accumulating evidence exists on the association of various pregnancy- and reproductive-health related-factors, including hypertensive pregnancy disorders, with future CVD risk [9, 10].",1
"Pre-eclampsia, in particular, is associated with future risk of chronic hypertension, CVD, and excess mortality [11].",1
"The future CVD risk is 2Ñsixfold in women with a history of pre-eclampsia compared to those without [12, 13], while the mortality risk is 1.13-fold higher [13].",1
"In T1D women, the mortality risk is increased after a pregnancy complicated by hypertension (4.3-fold) or pre-eclampsia (5.6-fold), compared to a non-diabetic pregnancy [14].",1
"However, less is known about future CVD risk.",1
"Although a hypertensive pregnancy and T1D are both well known risk factors for CVD, the effect of these combined has not been studied, especially accounting for the concurrent development of diabetic microvascular complications, such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic retinopathy.",1
"Previous results from our cohort demonstrate that the risk of DKD is increased in women after a pre-eclamptic pregnancy [15], as well as the risk of diabetic retinopathy after a pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension [16].",1
"Since DKD is one of the strongest risk factors for CVD [17] and also a major driver of the increased mortality [18] related to T1D, it is important to account for DKD when evaluating the CVD and mortality risk related to hypertensive pregnancies in T1D.",1
"Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the impact of hypertensive disorders in a T1D pregnancy on future CVD and mortality risk during a long follow-up, accounting for the concurrent development of diabetic microvascular complications.",1
"This study is part of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study, initiated in 1997, aiming to assess the impact of genetic, clinical, and environmental factors on the development of T1D complications.",1
"It is a cohort study involving adults with T1D, defined as T1D onset before the age of 40 years and initiated insulin treatment within a year of the T1D diagnosis.",1
"The present sub-study is part of a collaboration with the Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) WomenÕs hospital, where the follow-up and management of all T1D pregnancies in the Helsinki metropolitan area is centralized.",1
"All 429 T1D women that gave birth between 1988 and 1996 were invited to join the FinnDiane Study, and 195 agreed to participate between 2004 and 2006.",1
"[15] From this original cohort, we excluded one who withdrew her consent to participate, three lacking data on hypertensive disorders during the index pregnancy, and one with an unclear diabetes type, resulting in 190 women eligible for our study.",1
The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.,1
"The study protocol was approved by the HUS Ethics committee (91/E5/2006, 238/13/03/00/2015, and HUS/3313/2018) and the participants gave their written informed consent for study participation and subsequent use of their health data.",1
"From the index pregnancy, we had data available on calendar year of delivery, parity, age and T1D duration at delivery, age at T1D onset, and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.",1
The study cohort was grouped by the type of hypertensive disorder during the index pregnancy into four groups: 1.,1
"No hypertension, 2.",1
"Chronic hypertension, where hypertension (diastolic blood pressure_³_90 mmHg measured after 10 min of rest by the nurse during a regular outpatient clinic appointment during pregnancy) had occurred before week 20 of the index pregnancy, 3.",1
"Gestational hypertension, where hypertension (diastolic blood pressure_³_90 mmHg or 15 mmHg higher than before the pregnancy) occurred not earlier than week 20 of the index pregnancy, and 4.",1
"Pre-eclampsia, where gestational hypertension was accompanied by proteinuria of at least 300 mg/24 h [15, 16].",1
"Data on CVD events and mortality were retrieved for all participants until the end of 2020 from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care Hilmo, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, and the Cause of Death Registry, Statistics Finland.",1
"Our primary endpoint was a composite CVD event, including acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, hospitalization due to heart failure, or CVD death (See Supplement Table 1 for the specific ICD codes and procedure codes used).",1
Our secondary endpoint was death from any cause.,1
"Follow-up time was calculated from the index pregnancy delivery until the first composite CVD event, death, or end of 2020.",1
The status of DKD (its onset and progression) was evaluated throughout the follow-up time.,1
"Data on DKD status were retrieved from FinnDiane study visits, medical records, and/or the Finnish Care Register for Health Care Hilmo, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (Supplement Table 1).",1
"DKD was defined as urinary albumin excretion rate in two out of three collections:_>_200 µg/min overnight,_>_300 mg/24 h, or albumin-creatinine ratio_>_30 mg/g in spot urine.",1
"Five participantsÕ kidney status could not be verified, and six participants had DKD before their index pregnancy, leaving 179/190 (94%) for the analyses accounting for DKD status during follow-up.",1
"Diabetic retinopathy during follow-up was defined as retinal photocoagulation, which was identified from the FinnDiane study visits and from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care Hilmo, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (Supplement Table 1).",1
"In 21 participants, retinal photocoagulation occurred before the index pregnancy, leaving 169/190 (89%) for the analyses adjusting for retinopathy during follow-up.",1
Baseline characteristics were compared for the four hypertension groups and for those with and without a CVD event or death during follow-up.,1
Symmetrically distributed variables were analyzed with the ANOVA test and data are presented as means_±_standard deviation.,1
Variables with skewed distribution were analyzed with the KruskalÐWallis test and data are presented as medians with interquartile range.,1
Categorical variables were analyzed with Chi2 test or FisherÕs exact test when appropriate.,1
The incidence of composite CVD events and all-cause mortality were analyzed and plotted by KaplanÐMeier survival analysis and the groups were compared with the log rank test.,1
The independent role of the different hypertensive disorders of pregnancy for the primary and secondary outcomes was analyzed with multivariable Cox regression analyses.,1
Variable selection was based on significance in univariable analysis with either the dependent variable or the outcome and included T1D onset age and age at delivery (thus indirectly adjusting also for T1D duration at delivery).,1
"To assess the impact of post-delivery DKD on the risk of CVD events and death and accounting both for its presence and duration, we performed separate Cox regression analyses including DKD as a time-dependent covariate.",1
Only the women without pre-pregnancy albuminuria and with an established DKD-status during follow-up were included in these analyses (N_=_179).,1
Corresponding analyses incorporating post-delivery diabetic retinopathy as a time-dependent covariate were also performed.,1
"Similarly, these analyses included only women without manifest diabetic retinopathy (defined as retinal photocoagulation) at the time of delivery (N_=_169).",1
"All Cox regression models met the proportional hazards assumption, as evaluated by Schoenfeld residuals.",1
We analyzed the data using the SPSS version 29.0.0.0 and the R open-source software (http://www.r-project.org) version 4.4.1.,1
Statistical significance was set at p_<_0.05.,1
"Our cohort, including 190 women with an index pregnancy between 1988 and 1996, had a median age at delivery of 29.4 years (interquartile range 26.0Ð33.0) and a median T1D duration of 14.7 (7.6Ð20.4) years.",1
"Of the index pregnancies, 132 (69.5%) were the womenÕs first, 44 (23.2%) their second, and 14 (7.4%) their third or fourth pregnancy.",1
The clinical characteristics of the cohort grouped by the type of hypertensive disorder during the index pregnancy is presented in Table 1.,1
Age at delivery was the highest in the gestational hypertension group and the lowest in the pre-eclampsia group.,1
"T1D duration was likewise the highest in those with gestational hypertension, while the shortest T1D duration was observed in those without hypertension, which was also the group with the highest T1D onset age.",1
Calendar year of delivery and parity did not differ between the hypertension groups.,1
"During a median 26.8 (24.2Ð30.0) years of follow-up, 46 (24.2%) women experienced a composite CVD event.",1
"There were no differences in age or T1D duration at delivery, T1D onset age, calendar year of delivery, or parity between those who did or did not develop a composite CVD event during follow-up (Supplement Table 2).",1
The cumulative incidence of composite CVD events during follow-up is presented in Fig. 1A.,1
The incidence of a composite CVD event was increased for all three hypertension groups compared to those without hypertension during the index pregnancy (Log rank p_<_0.05) and was the highest in those with pre-eclampsia (p_<_0.001).,1
"In Cox regression analysis adjusted for delivery age and age at T1D onset, the risk of a composite CVD event was increased for chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia, compared with no hypertension during pregnancy (Table 2).",1
"After further adjustment for the development of DKD during follow-up, chronic hypertension was no longer a risk factor for future CVD, while both gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia remained independently associated with future CVD risk.",1
"In a similar analysis, adjusting for the development of diabetic retinopathy during follow up, the results were similar to those that were adjusted for DKD (Table 2).",1
This study provides a novel finding that hypertension during pregnancy in women with T1D is associated with increased risk of CVD events during long-term follow-up.,1
"The highest, fivefold CVD risk was observed after a pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia, while chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension were associated with a 3.5-fold risk compared with women without hypertensive pregnancies.",1
"After accounting for DKD or diabetic retinopathy development during follow-up, chronic hypertension was no longer associated, while gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia were independently associated with future CVD events.",1
"Of note, 42% of the women with pre-eclampsia experienced future CVD events, compared to only 12% of those without hypertensive pregnancies, underscoring the importance of pregnancy-related complications as an indicator of future cardiovascular health in women with T1D.",1
"For all-cause mortality, pre-eclampsia and chronic hypertensionÑbut not gestational hypertensionÑwere associated with increased risk.",1
"However, after adjustment for development of DKD or diabetic retinopathy, none of the hypertensive disorders were associated with mortality, suggesting that the excess mortality is explained by the concomitant diabetic microvascular complications.",1
"Our collaboration between the FinnDiane Study and the Helsinki WomenÕs Hospital provides a unique view to the cardiovascular health of women with T1D and a pregnancy in the 1980s and 1990s [15, 16].",1
"From a historical perspective, during the first decades after insulin was invented, pregnancy was not recommended to women with T1D, due to poor prognosis of both the mother and the baby.",1
"Since the 1980s a pregnancy with a favorable outcome has been possible for an increasing number of women with T1D, due to the improvements in glucose monitoring and improved insulin regimen [19, 20].",1
"The treatment of T1D has further improved in the last decades, with continuous glucose monitoring and insulin analogues becoming routine care [21].",1
"Although many centers have reported improved pregnancy outcomes in T1D pregnancies, complications such as fetal macrosomia, hypertensive pregnancy complications, and stillbirths remain significantly more common in women with T1D than in the general population [22Ð25] Additionally, the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications has improved and resulted in a decrease in the incidence of CVD.",1
"[26] Taking these improvements into account, it is possible that our results overestimate the future CVD risk for T1D women pregnant today.",1
"Previous studies regarding the impact of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy on later CVD risk in women with T1D are scarce, although both hypertension in pregnancy [13, 27, 28] and T1D [2, 26] are known risk factors for CVD.",1
"A Danish study assessed the impact of pre-eclampsia and pre-pregnancy diabetes on mortality in almost 1,000 T1D women with a pregnancy in the 1990s, compared to women matched from the background population [14].",1
"They observed a 5.55 (2.71Ð11.4)-fold increased mortality risk among the mothers with T1D and pre-eclampsia, compared to the mothers without T1D.",1
"This is somewhat higher than in our study, but can probably be explained by the different reference groups.",1
"They also had data on DKD and found that DKD before pregnancy also increases mortality; however, they did not analyze how DKD influenced mortality associated with pre-eclampsia.",1
"In another study from Norway involving more than 600,000 women from the general population and 2,204 women with pre-pregnancy diabetes, all of whom had their first delivery in 1967Ð1994, pre-eclampsia increased the mortality only in those with T1D and only one pregnancy [29].",1
"Parity did not influence mortality in our study, but on the other hand, we did not have data on all pregnancies of the participating women.",1
"We found that DKD and diabetic retinopathy, indeed, modify the risk related to hypertensive disorders during pregnancies and future risk of CVD events and mortality from any cause.",1
"This was partly expected since we have previously reported an association between hypertensive pregnancies and future risk of DKD and diabetic retinopathy [15, 16], both of which are also associated with CVD risk and mortality in T1D [26].",1
Our study did not indicate that hypertension during pregnancy in women with T1D is associated with excess mortality independent of DKD.,1
"This can be due to the small number of deaths in our study population, reducing the statistical power.",1
"The hazard ratios were, however, clearly lower after adjusting for DKD, indicating that concomitant DKD modifies the risk.",1
"For CVD events, DKD had also an impact on the magnitude of the association, especially reducing the risk related to pre-eclampsia, while for gestational hypertension, the HR was higher after DKD adjustment.",1
These findings suggest shared and/or differing pathophysiology between hypertensive pregnancies and diabetic vascular complications.,1
"In case of chronic hypertension, the increased CVD risk relates to concomitant microvascular complications, while for gestational hypertension the CVD risk is not modified by DKD and diabetic retinopathy.",1
"In pre-eclampsia, the increased risk of DKD [15] only partly explains the increased CVD risk, indicating that there are other mechanisms as well.",1
"One possible mechanism could be dysfunction of the vascular endothelium, which is the main pathophysiological mechanism of pre-eclampsia [30].",1
"Our chronic hypertension group was heterogenous, since all we know about this group is that they had hypertension before their 20th gestational weekÑnot enabling us to figure out if some of them also had superimposed pre-eclampsia [15, 16].",1
Superimposed pre-eclampsia is one of the four categories of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and includes women with signs of pre-eclampsia accompanied by chronic hypertension [31].,1
"Although we were able to assess DKD during follow-up, we did not have complete data on the presence of the milder forms of albuminuria before pregnancy, and thus, were not able to assess the impact of moderate albuminuria.",1
"Furthermore, the pre-eclampsia group might include some cases with DKD even if there was no real evidence of pathophysiology typical to pre-eclampsia in their case.",1
"Another limitation is that we did not have data from the womenÕs every pregnancy and, thus, were not able to account for the history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy prior or after the index pregnancy.",1
"Furthermore, our cohort was relatively small with only 190 women, but on the other hand, the follow-up time was long and there was a considerable amount of CVD events.",1
"The strength of our study lies in the careful characterization of the cohort, especially regarding the development of DKD and diabetic retinopathy during the follow-up period.",1
"In conclusion, women with T1D and a history of a hypertensive pregnancy have an increased risk of CVD events.",1
"However, in our study, a hypertensive pregnancy was not a risk factor for mortality independently of DKD.",1
These findings highlight the importance of routinely assessing the history of pregnancy complications when assessing CVD risk in women with T1D.,1
"For women with a history of a hypertensive pregnancy, more aggressive CVD prevention strategies should be considered.",1
"Furthermore, improved communication between obstetrics and diabetes care units after a hypertensive pregnancy is needed, to ensure optimal postpartum care and life-long CVD prevention of women with T1D.",1
Logos have been an integral part of history since the emergence of written language.,1
"Logo origins can be traced back to the earliest societies in which symbols were used to depict persons, places, and even events.",1
"Similarly, today logos act as an extension of company branding.",1
"To help companies create their unique identity, designers invent logos that express a desired philosophy better than words can.",1
"Logos can tell a story by illustrating a businessÕ brand, vision, ambitions, and core values.",1
"In this edition of Young ProfessionalsÕ Guide To, we explore two major oil and gas company logos and probe into their hidden meaning.",1
"The story of BP began in 1908 when a meter-high fountain of oil burst into the sky near Masjid-i-Suleiman, Persia (now, Iran) and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) was formed in 1909, as a subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company.",1
"In 1914, APOC signed a 30-year contract with the British Admiralty for supplying oil for the Royal Navy at the fixed price.",1
"In 1915, APOC established its shipping subsidiary the British Tanker Company and in 1916 it acquired the British Petroleum Company which was a marketing arm of the German Europische Petroleum Union in Britain.",1
Back then the company was represented by the bold letters ÒBPÓ written on a shield.,1
"In 1935, the international community began referring to Persia as Iran and hence, the APOC was renamed to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC).",1
"After a series of agreements, mergers, and acquisitions, the AIOC became the British Petroleum Company in 1954.",1
"1959, the company expanded to the US by making a significant discovery in Prudhoe Bay in Alaska.",1
"When the oil started to flow from Alaska, no BP refineries or stations in the US were there to take it and hence, the company acquired a 25% stake in the Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) to ensure a stable market.",1
"BPÕs stake in Sohio grew over the years, and in 1987 BP bought the company, incorporating it into a new national business, BP America.",1
Color was added to the logo in 1947.,1
"Created by the noted industrial designer Raymond Loewy, it was unveiled in 1979.",1
The logo was slightly modified in 1989 as a lighter shade was added to give it a ÒgreenerÓ appearance.,1
"The emblem was also simplified, and a yellow border was drawn around the shield.",1
The characters were also italicized.,1
This version was used by BP until 2000.,1
"In 2000, BP Amoco acquired the US-based Arco and the lubricants and specialty company Burmah Castrol.",1
"Following these series of acquisitions, the company shortened its name to BP to identify as a single brand.",1
"In an attempt to rebrand itself as an environmentally aware energy company, instead of an oil company, it opted for the expansion of Beyond Petroleum.",1
The new BP logo consisted of a ÒHeliosÓ (ancient Greek god of the sun who drove his chariot across the sky each day) symbol which featured a green and yellow sunflower epitomizing energy in its various forms.,1
The colors are both indicative of power and the natural world.,1
BP is the only corporation to have received an Oscar.,1
"The company won the award for the 1960 documentary film Giuseppina, which it sponsored and distributed.",1
The trophy currently sits in the reception of BPÕs Sunbury office.,1
"The history of this iconic American company dates to when Pacific Coast Oil Co, was incorporated in 1879 in San Francisco, California by acquiring the petroleum pioneer Ð California Star Oil Works.",1
The first logo contained the company name against a backdrop of wooden derricks set among the Santa Susana Mountains that loomed over Pico Canyon.,1
This was the site of the company's Pico No.,1
4 Ð the first successful oil well in California.,1
"In 1878, Iowa Standard Oil Company entered the San Francisco market and by 1900, controlled a staggering 96.5% of the Western market in light oils.",1
"Coast Oil couldnÕt fight the StandardÕs marketing savvy and financial clout and hence, in 1900, agreed to be acquired by Standard while retaining the name of Pacific Coast Oil Company.",1
The company's rapid growth caused significant structural changes.,1
"In 1906, a consortium of Pacific Coast Oil and Iowa Standard Oil formed a new entity as a final step of the 6-year integration, the Standard Oil Company of California, or SoCal.",1
"In May 1911, a Supreme Court decision separated SoCal from its parent, a giant New York-based corporation, and this is when Standard Oil Co.",1
of California trademarked the name Chevron and the three-bar chevron logo.,1
"Originally, Chevron remained limited to the western United States.",1
"In 1946, the company adopted the Calso name for the northeastern market, including Vermont, using the red and white station design seen below.",1
"In 1969, the company developed a new logo consisting of two bold stripes, red and blue, topped with the Chevron name.",1
"To establish a uniform identity and to consolidate the organization, the company formed Chevron USA. Inc.",1
"in 1977, merging six domestic oil and gas operations into one.",1
"Intuitively, the company chose ""Chevron"" as its name echoing a word that had first appeared on its products in the 1930s and had become an iconic benchmark among consumers worldwide.",1
"In 1984, the company nearly doubled its worldwide proved oil and gas reserves overnight by acquiring the nationÕs fifth-largest petroleum companyÑGulf Oil Corp.",1
The acknowledgment that the industryÕs best opportunities often involved mega-projects that required the resources of more than a single corporation led the company to form a corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&A) group in January 1998.,1
"After a series of negotiations, the M&A group convinced the shareholders of Chevron and Texaco to merge into ChevronTexaco Corporation in October 2000.",1
This made Chevron the second largest US-based energy company with more than 11 billion bbl of oil and equivalent gas reserves along with 2.4 million B/D of refining capacity.,1
"Thus, three out of the seven sisters of oil and gas (Gulf Oil, SoCal, and Texaco) transformed into one big corporation embodied by Chevron.",1
"After the merger, the company started a new page in its story with a brand new nameÑChevron CorporationÑwhich became easily recognizable both in the local market and outside of the United States.",1
"In 2005, a strengthened company acquired Unocal Corporation, further enhancing its leading position.",1
"This decision allowed the company to diversify its E&P profile in the Caspian, Asia-Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico regions.",1
"Today, the logo of this iconic American company shows two downward angles in a clipped and parallel manner.",1
"They originate directly from the name of the company Chevron, which means ""angles"" in terms of badges of rank, as one of the interpretations.",1
"By the terms of the breakup of Standard Oil, under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1911, at first Standard Oil of California could use the Standard name only within its original geographic area of the Pacific coast states, plus Nevada and Arizona; outside that area, it had to use another name.",1
Today Chevron is the owner of the Standard Oil trademark in 16 states in the western and southeastern US.,1
"To maintain ownership of the mark, the company owns and operates one Standard-branded Chevron station in each state of the area, although its status in Kentucky is unclear after Chevron withdrew retail sales from Kentucky in July 2010.",1
"The term ÒdigitizationÓ has become ubiquitous, with major companiesÑfrom operators and drilling contractors to service and manufacturing companiesÑannouncing some sort of digital initiative.",1
"The purpose of this digitization is to allow the oil and gas industry to work more efficiently, unlocking savings in a cost-constrained environment while simultaneously developing technology to address future problems.",1
"Within operations, the onset of the digital technology in traditionally analog processes is a major paradigm shift.",1
"Replacing antiquated equipment and functions with automated processes controlled by systems means the nature of how the industry does business is changing, diverging from a historical norm.",1
"This transformation will be further accelerated by the emergence of IIoT [industrial Internet of things] leading to more big data, machine learning, and analytics as powerful business tools for the sector.",1
"However, what about the role of the digital in a different senseÑusing social media?",1
"Many might think that social media is not as prevalent in the oil and gas industry compared to others, including technology, due to a variety of factors: the makeup of the workforce, the remote locations of much field work, and the often-secretive nature of business and technology dealings, just to name a few.",1
"The burgeoning population of millennials in oil and gas and diversified, global workforce, however, means more and more engagement with social media will be necessary to attract top talent.",1
"In the past, having a functioning website was considered enough of an online presence; today, an online presence cannot be considered complete without social media.",1
"While the true value of engaging in social media may be nebulous, being an active participant in the major social networks provides unique opportunities for companies to engage entirely new subsets of employees and potential employees, building rapport and creating a platform for thought leadership, collaboration, and sharing.",1
"With that in mind, three primary purposes of social media in the oil and gas industry appear to be education, awareness, and business.",1
One purpose of social media is education.,1
It can be leveraged as a tool to reach both current and future industry employees as well as the public; social media can be used to explain the ÒhowÓ and ÒwhyÓ of oil and gas.,1
"Some people, for example, might seek out educational videos that explain technical concepts in simple, accessible language with accompanying visualsÑhow does equipment work, how does one drill a well, what is drilling fluid, why there are so many different drill bit designs.",1
"The potential list of topics is almost endless, particularly as the industry continues to grow and evolve with each passing year.",1
"Some of this is incorporated through excellent YouTube videos, but opportunities to integrate advertisement with such videos is extremely limited.",1
"The purpose of education is fulfilled by a broad range of sites, including those that bring in quizzes and devices for learning and knowledge transfer, and social media is the platform by which such information can be shared.",1
"This creates a feedback loop where educational content can be created, then consumed, then refined as commentary on the content comes up.",1
It was not possible to achieve such iterative improvement so quickly in the past.,1
"Social media can, and should, be used as a legitimate business tool.",1
"This can occur via both organic postingÑposts simply uploaded to an accountÑor through paid content, which involves paying the social media company to post and promote content to achieve higher engagement and viewing rates with targeted advertising.",1
"In both cases, social media platforms can help showcase what the company is doing, successful projects, new technologies, and so forth.",1
"It can also provide a forum to engage with the posts on the companyÕs page, allowing commenters to discuss content with SMEs [subject matter experts] and exchange relevant information; it can be, that is, a place for active collaboration and networking.",1
"Think reddit + Instagram, but for oil and gas.",1
"The posts can also potentially generate revenue, often due to the sheer volume of people viewing the content; in some instances, impressions (the number of times a post is viewed in a newsfeed) can exceed 100,000, a number that doesnÕt even include impressions from re-shares of the post and their related metrics.",1
"One can imagine the massive reach of social media when 100,000 or more people are viewing a single post, and a company is posting four or five times a week.",1
"If even one person makes a purchasing decision based on a social media post, it is likely that the social media budgetÑincluding hiring and retaining a social media coordinatorÑwill be covered, and then some.",1
"On 17 April this year, Gubkin University celebrated its 90th anniversary.",1
"Since its inception, the university has spearheaded oil and gas research and nurtured skilled oilfield leaders.",1
More than 15 large universities and research institutes have been established on the model of Gubkin.,1
"A rich history, thriving international partnerships, a vibrant SPE student chapter, unique oil- and gas-themed student activities, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and accomplished alumni are what makes Gubkin a leader in its field.",1
"Gubkin University was founded in 1930 by Ivan Gubkin, an eminent scientist, academician, and geologist.",1
He is widely considered to be the founder of petroleum geology.,1
His book The Study of Oil developed the theory on the origins of oil and laid out the principles of oil geology.,1
He was also a key facilitator of advanced petroleum education in Russia.,1
(More information on the history of Gubkin University can be found here.,1
"The university is focused on accelerating research and developmental activities, and expanding academic partnerships and exchange programs with different organizations and companies around the world.",1
"Currently, Gubkin University offers Joint MasterÕs Program and a Summer Exchange School Program with several leading universities such as IFP School (France), the University of Stavanger (Norway), Heriot-Watt University (UK), Texas A&M University (US), the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology (Germany), among others.",1
"Postgraduate students and researchers participate in research exchange programs such as the Ivan Gubkin Program jointly sponsored with DAAD, the German Academic Exchange Service.",1
"When I joined the Gubkin University SPE Student Chapter, I was amazed at how many foreign students, specialists, and professors knew about our university.",1
I learned the reason later: Gubkin University is an international platform for scientific and social cooperation.,1
"It also organizes various conferences, forums, intellectual games, and coordinates with international delegates on behalf of the university.",1
ÒGubkin University offers a huge number of international programs and trainings with leading oil and gas universities and companies from all over the world.,1
Each Gubkin student has plenty of ways to improve himself or herself within student organizations where everyone can find a suitable place.,1
"Multiple international SPE awards attest to this: Outstanding Chapter Award in 2012, 2014, 2018, and Gold Standard Award in 2012, 2015, 2017, 2019.",1
The chapter has also had the privilege of hosting the current and former SPE presidents.,1
The 2020 SPE President - Shauna Noonan and the SPE Regional Director for Russia & Caspian - Aizhana Jussupbekova during a visit to Gubkin University.,1
Most Gubkin students don a distinctive Òmining engineerÕs uniformÓ when attending formal events or posing for photographs.,1
ÒGubkin University is one of my favorite schools in the world.,1
I think you have set a great example as a leading university in your field.,1
"Students participate in various activities, including conferences, competitions, social events, sports tournaments, and study tours both in Russia and abroad.",1
Three popular student activities are modeled around prominent oil and gas themes.,1
Mister Gas Contest.,1
The contest is organized in conjunction with the MOSGAZ company.,1
Participants are judged on their physical endurance through competitions like overcoming a challenging obstacle course and hitting targets with a small-bore rifle as well as their presentation skills and ballroom etiquette.,1
Some of the jury are drawn from leading oil and gas companies.,1
Miss University_Oil Queen Contest.,1
The contest is held on the eve of the International WomenÕs Day.,1
"Participants are judged based on their singing skills, dancing skills, and general knowledge.",1
Several members of the jury are drawn from leading oil and gas companies.,1
Multiple winners are chosen via audience voting.,1
"Over 35,000 viewers watched the live broadcast in 2020.",1
University Cheerleading TeamÐBarrel.,1
Gubkin UniversityÕs cheerleading and dance team is called the ÒBarrel.Ó It is widely considered to be one of the best teams in Russia.,1
Team Barrel won the Open European Championship held in Paris in 2016.,1
The team frequently uses props associated with the oil and gas industry.,1
"An important day in the life of Gubkin students is the ÒGubkin Day.Ó On Gubkin Day a gala concert is held at an important building called the Palace of Culture ÒGubkinets."" A faculty parade, creative performances, and demonstrations of national traditions mark Gubkin UniversityÕs birthday on 17 April.",1
Two among many distinctive Gubkin University buildings are an extensive museum complex and a long photo gallery.,1
"The museum boasts a collection of 3,000 exhibits and many oil and gas equipment models.",1
"The Portrait Gallery, inaugurated on the universityÕs 75th anniversary, features over 250 portraits of distinguished faculty and alumni.",1
The university applies an interdisciplinary approach to training.,1
"Innovative, interactive full-scale simulators and systems such as Virtual Field, Virtual Oil and Gas Transportation System, Virtual Oil Refinery etc., are made available to students to provide them with oilfield experience within the safety of the universityÕs four walls.",1
"In cooperation with Rosneft and Gazprom, Russia NOCs, the university implements long-term projects to create comprehensive multi-level educational technology and infrastructure for training specialists in the development of the Arctic and Eastern Siberian reserves and for transportation of hydrocarbon products to the Asia Pacific region.",1
"Now I can say that I am delighted with the infrastructure, laboratory facilities, technical equipment of classrooms, and management of Gubkin University!"" - Sami Al-Nuaim, 2019 SPE President, visiting Gubkin University in 2019.",1
Vasily Podshibyakin was a Soviet geologist.,1
"He contributed to the discovery of several gas fields including ÒUrengoy,Ó the world's second largest natural gas field.",1
"In 1909, Julius Fried, a grocer, purchased land in Kern County, California, and founded the Lakeview Oil Company.",1
"In March 1910, after months of unsuccessful drilling that forced the sale of a controlling stake to Union Oil, oil struck at 2,200 ft.",1
"While running a bailer, the workers heard and felt a rumbling from under the well.",1
They ran for it.,1
What followed was the worldÕs largest oil spill on land.,1
"As the well blew out, the geyser was reported to have reached up to 200 ft in the air and was so forceful it not only demolished the wooden derrick sitting above it, but it also turned the top of the wellbore into a crater.",1
"The well flowed uncontrolled for 17 months, releasing an estimated 9 million barrels of crude to the surface.",1
"In September 1911, a subsurface collapse of the wellbore obstructed further flow.",1
"During the wellÕs blowout, workers scrambled to build berms to contain and direct the flow of oil in order to collect as much of the bounty as possible.",1
"Despite their efforts, it is estimated that only half of the 9 million barrels was recovered.",1
"At the time, the oil price was $0.61/bbl, which means that the Lakeview Gusher earned only $2.745 million.",1
"Adjusting for inflation, at approximately $16/bbl today, it would have brought in a modest $72 million.",1
What changed: Large and well publicized industry disasters usually lead to a change in best practices.,1
"However, in its time, the Lakeview Gusher was not considered a disaster at all.",1
"In fact, it was considered a good omen as it suggested an abundance of oil in the area, and even became something of a tourist attraction for its duration.",1
"Despite the eraÕs nonchalance about the worst oil spill in history, innovation did eventually find its way to the drilling process.",1
"In particular, the worldÕs first ram-type blowout preventer (BOP) was described in a patent application in 1922 and on the market in 1924 thanks to a collaboration between James S. Abercrombie and Harry S. Cameron (of Cameron Wellhead Systems).",1
This BOP and the many subsequent iterations and improvements to it over the past century can be credited with improving both the safety and environmental records of the exploration and production process.,1
The types of disasters that make headlines when BOPs fail (such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill) are a further testament to just how much the invention of the BOP improved the industry.,1
"The offshore platform, Piper Alpha, situated in the Piper oil field, was built in 1975.",1
This platform was owned by a consortium of international companies and operated by Occidental Petroleum.,1
"In its time, Piper Alpha was the most prolific platform in the North Sea, responsible for 10% of oil and gas produced by UK, about 300,000 BOPD.",1
On 6 July 1988 there were 226 crew members onboard the platform.,1
"At 2145, Geoff Bollands, the chief control room operator heard an alarm, indicating a problem with one of the platformÕs two condensate pumps.",1
"To maintain power for ongoing construction work, the second condensate pump was restarted.",1
This pump had been taken off line for maintenance earlier in the day and maintenance had not been completed.,1
"At the time it was restarted, the second pump was still missing a safety valve, the absence of which permitted a high-pressure gas leak.",1
"At approximately 2155, gas leaking from the second condensate pump ignited, causing an explosion.",1
Damage caused by this explosion catalyzed three further explosions caused by ruptures in the pipelines connecting Piper Alpha to surrounding platforms.,1
"The resulting fires exceeded 700¡C and decimated the 14,000-ton platform.",1
The intensity of the flames prevented onboard crew from accessing evacuation routes and lifeboats and prevented rescue vehicles from approaching.,1
By 2350 the platform began to collapse.,1
The fires took more than 3 weeks to extinguish.,1
"A total of 167 people, 165 platform personnel, and 2 rescuers lost their lives, most due to smoke inhalation.",1
Only 61crew members survived.,1
In addition to this tragic loss of lifeÑthe worst in offshore historyÑfinancial losses totaled an estimated £2 billion (the equivalent of $5 billion today).,1
Offshore operators acted on factors that were perceived to have caused or contributed to the severity of the tragedy.,1
These included improving permit-to-work systemsÑwhich if properly implemented would have informed the night crew that the second condensate pump was off line; relocating pipeline emergency shutdown valves and installing subsea pipeline isolation systemsÑeither of which may have prevented neighboring platforms from continuing to pump fuel to the Piper Alpha after the initial explosion; and mitigation of smoke hazards and improvements to evacuation routesÑboth of which might have allowed more crew members to escape from the platform after the explosion.,1
"In addition to these changes, Scottish judge William Cullen reviewed the incident and summarized his findings in the two-volume, 400-page Cullen Report filed in 1990.",1
"TheCullen Report included 106 safety recommendations, of which 37 pertained to equipment operation, 32 to communicating information to platform personnel, 25 to platform design, and 12 to communcating with emergency services.",1
"Perhaps the most significant of Lord CullenÕs recommendations was codified in the Offshore Safety Act 1992 and the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992, requiring operators to provide a safety case for each offshore installation, detailing how a platform could be run safely, providing for the management of personnel health and safety, and providing for the handling of major accidents on the installation.",1
These were revised in 2005 to improve effectiveness and remain in force today.,1
"A horrific scene erupted the night of 20 April 2010 when a deadly blowout occurred during the temporary abandonment of BPÕs Macondo exploratory prospect, which was being drilled by TransoceanÕs Deepwater Horizon.",1
"Approximately 50 miles off the Louisiana coast, the well was situated 18,000 ft below mean sea level and involved operations at depths of up to 5,000 ft.",1
Incident investigation reports highlight an combination of causes facilitating the disaster.,1
"However, the main culprit was a bad cement job, which failed to prevent gas from escaping through the marine riser up to the rig floor where it subsequently ignited and exploded.",1
Multiple opportunities to identify and contain the leak were missed due to a combination of human error and equipment failure: a pressure test showing the leak was misinterpreted; the leak was diverted to a mud/gas separator that could not handle the volume; the gas alarm failed to shut ventilation to ignition sources; and multiple BOPs failed to close.,1
"The well could not be closed, and the oil continued to spew to the surface and the flames engulfed the rig platform.",1
Witnesses described the scene as huge fireballs visible from miles away.,1
"At the time of the incident, theDeepwater Horizon was inhabited by 126 crew members.",1
Eleven of the 126 were never found and were presumed dead.,1
Seventeen rig workers sustained critical injuries during the evacuation procedures.,1
"Thirty-six hours after the incident, the Deepwater Horizon sank while oil continued to flow from the well.",1
"It took almost 90 days to seal the well, during which time an estimated 4 million barrels leaked into the Gulf of Mexico.",1
"Cleanup took substantially longer, with oil-coated debris arriving on the Gulf shore up to 3 years after the incident.",1
The events surrounding the Deepwater Horizon disaster highlighted the role of the exploration and production industry in environmental responsibility and the need for robust well integrity management systems (WIMS) to prevent future incidents.,1
"The response has been dynamic, growing over the past 11 years with multiple initiatives taken to enhance the technical and managerial aspects of WIMS.",1
"Before this event, regulations were formed using a prescriptive approach that utilized a lessons-learned methodology.",1
"However, this process is dependent on the occurrence of events/incidents which can have far-reaching consequences, as was demonstrated by the Deepwater Horizon incident.",1
An incident would be followed by calls for action and intentions to prescribe safe practices.,1
This pattern was observed following the Montara oil spill just 8 months prior to the Macondo event.,1
"Following the Deepwater Horizon incident, a more proactive approach was adopted.",1
Concrete steps have been taken and significant resources invested to prevent another catastrophe rather than simply addressing the causes of the Deepwater Horizon.,1
"A review and reform was conducted for existing standards surrounding possible culprits such as cementing practices, cement bond log practices, and pressure-test analysis.",1
"The response to this incident was not limited to the immediate parties, rather it propelled joint industry collaborations focusing on improvement of procedures.",1
"This also led to improvement/review of various well integrity standards including those from American Petroleum Institute; NORSOK, the Norwegian standards agency; and International Association of Drilling Contractors.",1
"Further, the Minerals Management Service, responsible for overseeing drilling, was dissolved, and replaced with three new agencies that divided oversight so that a focus on regulation and safety was not clouded by leasing and revenue collection.",1
"Finally, even after capping the well, research continued into controlling the subsea release of oil, including focus on well containment at the seafloor, intervention, and containment within the subsea well, subsea collection and surface processing and storage, and relief wells..",1
"This componentÑongoing researchÑindicates the desire not just to learn from the most recent disaster, but to be prepared for potential iterations should such a misfortune occur.",1
"While equipment failure often plays a role in oilfield disasters, it is often augmented by human error.",1
While the industry has become significantly safer and infinitely more environmentally conscious than at its inceptionÑin part because of lessons learned from the disasters in its historyÑit still has the potential to be both disastrous and deadly when not approached with the caution and respect it is due.,1
Documentaries are used both to educate and tell stories that their makers believe should be heard.,1
That applies to documentaries about the inner workings of various industries such as oil and gas.,1
"To many outside the petroleum industry, those inner workings are a black box: Money and engineering goes in, gasoline and petrochemical products come out.",1
"It is also full of stories, making it an industry ripe for documentarians.",1
The following reviews consider a small handful of the documentaries covering the petroleum industry and what might be learned from them beyond their immediate message.,1
"One of the most (in)famous documentaries concerning the oil and gas industry, Gasland is short on facts and long on feelings.",1
"Nonetheless, it offers an important lesson to the industry.",1
"Beginning in the Marcellus Shale, Fox travels to shale basins across the US where oil and gas operations overlap with the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans.",1
He invites them to tell their stories while expounding on what he believes to be the unregulated harm caused by every step in the life of an unconventional well.,1
One theme in particular stands out throughout Gasland: None of the aggrieved parties feels they have been heard by the operators near them or by government agencies who should be addressing their concerns.,1
The documentary is not concerned with bad engineering as much as bad community relations.,1
"During the initial shale boom, oil and gas operations moved into areas that did not have large-scale operations, bringing the companies into contact with a population that had no familiarity with the industry.",1
"Inadequate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) protocols failed in the development of a social license to operate: If outreach efforts had been adequate, Gasland would never have been made.",1
"Gasland is important as an indicator of the consequences of failing to properly engage the communities in which the industry operates, a lesson that the American industry has taken to heart in the decade since the documentary was released.",1
Improved technologies and best practices (such as quiet fracture fleets and use of produced water when feasible) help reduce the acute impact of local operations.,1
"Equally important, though, is improved and proactive outreach designed to explain the petroleum process and highlight the widespread benefits it brings.",1
FoxÕs inaccuracies were less attributable to malice than they were to the understandable difficulty in making sense of the entire lifecycle of a well and associated regulatory regimes.,1
"As the experts in the field, it is the industryÕs responsibility (and in its own best interest) to help disseminate accurate information every step of the way.",1
"The industry has become bolder in standing up for itself as a crucial industry and force for good, even if it has to do so tongue-in-cheek, as the Colorado Oil and Gas Association recently did when it recognized The North Face with an ÒExtraordinary CustomerÓ award.",1
Public outreach will become even more crucial as prospective investors weigh ESG factors ever more heavily before making investment decisions.,1
The industry is rightfully proud about its role in improving the lot of humanityÑas well as its ability to overcome engineering and regulatory obstacles in the processÑbut it must continue to expand its message to the broader population.,1
ÒCanÕt we build a solar panel instead?Ó muses Fox at one point.,1
Perhaps he would have been less eager about that alternative if he had also looked into the environmental impact of mining rare earth metals.,1
Or perhaps he doesnÕt mind so long as itÕs not in his backyard.,1
"Switch features an analysis of the worldÕs energy outlook, provided by Scott W.",1
"Tinker, an American geologist, educator, and energy expert.",1
"It is a product of the Switch Energy Alliance, a nonpartisan, nonprofit, organization dedicated to providing energy education.",1
"Over the course of his analysis, Tinker travels the world, searching out prime examples of different energy sources and experts to discuss them with.",1
"Premiering in 2012, in some regards Switch shows its age.",1
Some of the concerns addressed include shrinking oil supply and problems of energy storage for intermittent renewables.,1
"While neither of these are solved problems today, technological advancement has changed the landscape significantly in both arenas.",1
"However, this does not detract from the overall quality or message Tinker wants to convey.",1
His central question is: What will the energy transition look like?,1
"On his journey, he evaluates coal, oil, biofuels, natural gas, wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, and nuclear on their merits and shortcomings as potential energy sources of the future.",1
Coal and oil are dominant because of their economics.,1
"Their abundance, energy density, and transportability are unrivaled by any other option.",1
"As a result, he concludes, it is unreasonable to expect developing, industrializing nations with large populations and growing middle classes (i.e., China and India) to ignore a resource that all industrialized countries have leveraged in their development journey.",1
"Unfortunately, Tinker does not believe that cleaning emissions from these sources at scale will be economical, meaning the world will have to live with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and associated consequences.",1
"The challenge, then, is for alternate energy sources to maintain the advantages of coal and oil while minimizing disadvantages at an economically competitive price.",1
"Unfortunately, all existing alternate sources face various issues that prevent them from meeting these criteria.",1
"Geothermal, hydropower, solar, and wind power require specific geologies or climates to make them viable.",1
Moving power away from these locations requires transmission infrastructure.,1
"Solar and wind also suffer from intermittency issues that require efficient energy storage, reliable baseline capacity, or both.",1
"Nuclear requires significant upfront investment, an extraordinarily long lead time, and the savvy to overcome the stigma of public perception.",1
"While alternate energy sources are superior to conventional sources in that they do not produce harmful emissions, Tinker does fail to consider other issues surrounding many alternate sources Ñthe cost and impact of building and decommissioning them.",1
What is the impact of mining the rare earth minerals necessary to build solar panels at scale?,1
What is the downstream impact of damming rivers to generate hydropower?,1
What will be done with the blades of decommissioned wind turbines or the heavy metals of decommissioned solar panels?,1
These are nontrivial considerations when determining whether an alternate energy source is superior to existing ones.,1

Assessment of relationship between the angiographic stenosis severity and the coronary blood flow is complex.,1
Coronary angiography has many limitations that may impair the judgment of stenosis severity and then affect decision-making regarding intervention.,1
"Myocardial perfusion imaging by single-photon emission tomography (MPI-SPECT) is used for a long time to help clinical decisions of interventions, but has limitations, such as issues with identification of extensive coronary artery disease (CAD).",1
Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a gold standard index for investigating the physiological significance of a coronary stenosis.,1
The instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is a hyperemia-free measurement and easier method to achieve physiological assessment to measure the severity of coronary stenosis.,1
We present a case of multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD) patient who was treated with iFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and emphasize the importance of physiological assessment in PCI.,1
A 63-year-old male with multiple cardiovascular risk factors came to our center with chief complaint of stable angina since 1 year.,1
He underwent MPI-SPECT and the result showed 2.5% of ischemia burden.,1
Coronary angiography showed MVCAD.,1
Surgical conference decided to do PCI.,1
iFR-guided PCI was performed in this case.,1
Our case highlights the importance of iFR as an important cardiologyÐphysiology-based tool as a guide in management decisions for MVCAD.,1
iFR as an alternative approach to physiological study is noninferior compared with FFR-guided PCI.,1
Multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD) is defined by the presence of ³50% diameter stenosis of two or more epicardial coronary arteries.,1
The presence of MVCAD indicates poorer prognosis and a significantly higher mortality than single-vessel disease.,1
"In MVCAD, revascularization can be achieved by either PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting.",1
"1 In MVCAD, revascularization modality should depend on a multifactorial evaluation, taking into account not only coronary anatomy, ischemic burden, myocardial function, age and the presence of comorbidities, but also the adequacy of myocardial revascularization.",1
Assessment of coronary stenosis with coronary angiography has several limitation.,1
"Although the benefit of coronary revascularization occurs mainly in patients with flow-limiting stenoses, the majority of stable patients are still managed on the basis of the coronary angiography alone, frequently without prior non-invasive functional assessment.",1
Functional assessment is an important tool that can guide management decisions for MVCAD determining whether the patient would benefit from revascularization or medical therapy.,1
"Owing to its wide availability, non-invasiveness, and high diagnostic performance, use of myocardial perfusion imaging by single-photon emission tomography (MPI-SPECT) has become a common practice for CAD screening, characterization, and follow-up.",1
Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is now accepted as the reference standard to indicate whether a stenosis is likely to be responsible for ischemia.,1
It is a pressure wire-based index that is used during coronary angiography to assess the potential of a coronary stenosis to induce myocardial ischemia.,1
Vasodilator such as adenosine is used to achieved constant and minimal microvascular resistance in FFR procedure.,1
Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is a pressure-only index that takes an alternative approach to the isolation of hemodynamic of a stenosis from the microcirculation without using vasodilator.,1
It was introduced with the attempt to make the assessment of stenosis severity quicker and easier.,1
A 63-year-old male with multiple cardiovascular risk factors came to outpatient clinic of National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita after being referred from general hospital for further management of CAD.,1
He came with chief complaint of stable angina 1 year ago.,1
The patient had a history of admission due to inferior ST-elevation of myocardial infarction in 2019 at a general hospital and was undergo coronary angiography with the result of CAD with triple-vessels disease.,1
Hypertension and history of smoking were his atherosclerotic risk factor.,1
Physical examination revealed the blood pressure of 124/82_mm Hg and other physical examination found no remarkable findings.,1
"Electrocardiography examination showed slight ST elevation III aVF, ST depression V5-V6, and Q wave II-III aVF.",1
Echocardiography revealed reduced LV systolic function (LVEF) 17% with reduced RV contractility (TAPSE 10_mm) and regional wall motion abnormalities.,1
"MPI-SPECT was done with result ischemic burden 2.5% with reversible myocardial ischemia at mid anterior (left anterior descending [LAD]), partial reversible at apico anterior (LAD), and irreversible ischemia at apico-mid anteroseptal (LAD), mid-basal inferoseptal (RCA), basal inferolateral, and mid-basal anterolateral (left circumflex artery [LCx]) ( Fig. 1 ).",1
Surgical conference decided to do PCI LAD with coronary physiology study.,1
"FFR is defined as maximum myocardial blood flow in a stenotic territory, divided by normal maximum blood flow in that same territory in the hypothetical case that the supplying coronary artery would be completely normal.5",1
5 The instant wave-free ratio (iFR) has been introduced as an alternative to FFR.,1
iFR is a resting index of stenosis severity that provides physiological quantification of the effect of stenosis on the coronary circulation.,1
"In MVCAD patients with regional wall motion abnormalities or ventricular dysfunction, assessment of myocardial viability may be done to select patients that are more likely to benefit from myocardial revascularization.6",1
"In this case, patients complaint of angina.",1
Most patients with significant stenosis are symptomatic due to disturbance of supply to large myocardial territory.,1
"However, visual estimates of intermediate and significant stenosis from coronary angiography have significant interobserver variability.",1
"Non-invasive study using MPI-SPECT was done to evaluate the myocardial viability in approaching the indication of revascularization.6,7",1
A low ischemic burden of 2.5% was calculated and felt to be unremarkable for revascularization.,1
"With chief complaint of angina that was provoked by activity and multivessel disease that was revealed by coronary angiography, the result of low ischemic burden was considered inconsistent.",1
"We decide to do further physiological assessment by iFR, consistent with ESC recommendation in approaching the indication of revascularization.",1
"As a resting index, iFR presents several advantages over hyperemic indices which could propel the use of coronary physiology well beyond their current use.5",1
"Adenosine, as also hyperemic agent, causes transient blood pressure reduction which can be of relevant magnitude in some cases.",1
"Individual response to adenosine is largely variable, higher concentrations should warrant an adequate response in a larger number of patients, but it may have a larger impact on hemodynamics which could negatively impact FFR measurements. 3",1
Objective ischemia assessment can be performed with either modality because both FFR and iFR have been demonstrated to show no significant differences in the prediction of myocardial ischemia from 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography.,1
"Additionally, iFR-guided revascularization was noninferior to FFR-guided revascularization for major adverse cardiac events at 1-year follow-up in two separate, large randomized multicenter trials.8",1
"In this case, iFR strongly supports decision-making regarding treatment selection in patients with multivessel disease. 3,9",1
"iFR in LCx revealed the ratio of 0.93, so we decided to not perform PCI in this lesion because it was physiologically nonsignificant stenosis.",1
"In contrast, because of the significant stenosis in distal LAD with iFR 0.78 and D1 with iFR 0.41, PCI distal LAD and D1 were done in this patient to increase the estimated iFR to its optimal level.",1
It was proven by an increase in iFR after stenting to 0.98 and 0.95 in the distal LAD and D1.,1
"Despite near complete or complete angiographic revascularization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grade ³ 2b) following endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), roughly 50% of patients exhibit persistent functional deficits.",1
We examined if functional decline in the acute setting post-EVT as measured via the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) predicted long-term disability and if functional decline was explained by medical complications.,1
"Through retrospective review, we identified 197 patients who underwent EVT for AIS secondary to a large vessel occlusion (LVO) between November 2015 and June 2022.",1
"Patient demographics, clinical assessment scales, stroke data (i.e., LVO location, etiology), disposition, and postoperative complications were collected.",1
Comparative analysis via t-tests and ANOVA using R studio software was employed where appropriate to compare preoperative and postoperative variables collected.,1
"Among our cohort, 159 patients underwent EVT for an anterior LVO and achieved a TICI score of ³ 2b.",1
"72 patients (47%) achieved a TICI score of 2b, 1 patient (1%) achieved a TICI score of 2c, and 82 patients (52%) achieved a TICI score of 3.",1
"We excluded 2 patients for who expired at 48 hours due to brain herniation, 1 patient who was discharged after 1 day, and 1 patient who expired at 96 hours but did not have any NIHSS scores recorded.",1
17 patients were removed for not having daily NIHSS scores available for analysis.,1
"Among the 138 remaining patients, 52 (38%) experienced a functional decline (+FD) following initial improvement between 0-72 hours post-recanalization.",1
"After removing an additional 23 patients who did not have reported mRS scores at 90 days (n = 115, +FD = 45) as well as patients who experienced hemorrhagic transformation (HT) (n = 101, +FD = 41), the mean change in mRS score between groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0499) with a mean mRS score increase of 3.33 for the +FD group compared to 2.48 for the -FD group.",1
"When removing patients who experienced complications beyond HT during their hospitalization that could have also potentially affected their daily NIHSS scores (n = 84, +FD = 35), mean change in mRS score between groups was statistically insignificant.",1
"Despite undergoing successful recanalization, 42% of patients in our cohort experienced an unexplained functional decline.",1
We believe that future studies using perfusion imaging analysis could perhaps attribute this phenomenon to impaired microvascular reperfusion despite complete recanalization and determine its clinical significance in neurosurgery.,1
We retrospectively identified 197 patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke secondary to a large vessel occlusion (LVO) between November 2015 and June 2022 Among this cohort 159 patients underwent EVT for an anterior LVO and achieved revascularization as evidenced by a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 2b or higher.,1
"75 patients (47.2%) achieved a TICI score of 2b, 1 patient (0.6%) achieved a TICI score of 2c, and 83 patients (52.2%) achieved a TICI score of 3.",1
"For our statistical analysis, we excluded 2 patients for who expired at 48 hours due to brain herniation, 1 patient who was discharged after 1 day, and 1 patient who expired at 96 hours but did not have any NIHSS scores recorded in the their medical record, reducing our total cohort to 155 patients.",1
The mean age of our cohort was 69.1 years (SD ± 14.6 years).,1
"The median admission NIHSS, GCS, and pre-stroke mRS scores were 17, 12, and 0, respectively.",1
72 patients (46.5%) of our patient cohort received tPA in addition to EVT.,1
"25 patients (16.1%) underwent hemorrhagic transformation (HT) as identified on CT or MRI within the acute post-operative period examined, which was 120 hours.",1
"the median ICU length of stay (LOS) and hospital LOS were 4 and 11 days, respectively.",1
"The median mRS for patients at 90 days was 4, and 88 of the 130 patients with reported mRS data at 90 days (56.8%) had a change in mRS greater than or equal to two points.",1
"The primary disposition location for patients was acute rehab (56 patients, 36.2%), and 27 patients (17.4%) expired during their hospitalization.",1
"The primary LVO location was L MCA (80 patients, 51.6%).",1
17 patients were removed for not having daily NIHSS scores available for analysis.,1
"Among the 138 patients, 52 (37.7%) experienced a functional decline (+FD) following initial improvement between 0-72 hours post successful recanalization (defined as a TICI score ³ 2b).",1
"When performing a comparative analysis between the +FD and -FD groups, mean ICU length of stay (LOS) was statistically insignificant and hospital LOS trended towards significance (p = 0.15).",1
"After removing an additional 23 patients that did not have a reported mRS score at 90 days (total n = 115, +FD = 45), the mean change in mRS between pre-stroke and at 90 days trended towards significance (p = 0.169) and the mean mRS score at 90 days was found not to be statistically significant.",1
"After removing 18 patients who experienced HT (n = 120, +FD = 47), Mean ICU LOS remained statistically insignificant, and mean hospital LOS trended toward significance (p = 0.166).",1
"Following the removal of patients without reported mRS scores at 90 days (n = 101, +FD = 41), the mean change in mRS score between groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0499) with mean absolute change of 3.33 for the +FD group compared for 2.48 for the -FD group.",1
"Next, we removed patients who experienced complications beyond hemorrhagic transformation during their hospitalization that could have also potentially affected their daily NIHSS scores, reducing the patient cohort to 84 (+FD = 35).",1
"Following this, mean change in mRS score, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS were all statistically insignificant.",1
"Still, between 0-72 hours following EVT, there were 35 patients with an unexplained functional decline following initial improvement.",1
"When conducting an ANOVA analysis comparing the mean change in mRS score by different disposition locations between patients (home, long-term acute care hospital, subacute rehab, acute rehab, skilled nursing facility, and expiration), mean changes in mRS scores between the following comparisons were statistically significant: expiration vs acute rehab (p < 0.0001), home x acute rehab (p < 0.0001), home x expiration (p < 0.0001), subacute rehab x home (p < 0.0001), and skilled nursing facility x home (p < 0.0001).",1
"After removing patients who underwent HT, the following groups were statistically significant: expiration x acute rehab (p < 0.0001), home x acute rehab (p < 0.0001), home x expiration (p < 0.0001), subacute rehab x home (p < 0.0001), and skilled nursing facility x home (p < 0.0001).",1
"Following the removal of patients who experienced complications during their hospitalization, the following groups were statistically significant: expiration x acute rehab (p < 0.0001), home x acute rehab (p < 0.01), home x expiration (p < 0.0001), and skilled nursing facility x home (p < 0.0001).",1
"When conducting an ANOVA comparing the mean hospital LOS by different disposition locations between patients, the following comparisons were statistically significant: home x acute rehab (p < 0.05), subacute rehab x home (p < 0.01), and skilled nursing facility x home (p < 0.001).",1

"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the very old (here defined as those aged 80 years or older), with a third of all strokes occurring in this age bracket in high-income countries.1 Despite this, the very old are often excluded from clinical trials examining stroke prevention.",1
"The result is that many primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies are not designed for older adults, and evidence-based treatments for this population are not available.2,3 The lack of studies involving the very old is especially concerning, considering that strokes are often more lethal for the older than, the younger brain.4 The journey for elderly stroke patients is unique from that of their younger counterparts.",1
"Primary and secondary preventative interventions, treatment selection at first occurrence, and long-term outcomes often differ between these patient cohorts.5 Risk mitigation strategies of the most common comorbidities in the elderly are primarily based on the results of RCTs, in which patients of advanced age were often underrepresented or excluded by trial design.6 As a result, selection bias may limit the generalizability of evidence from many landmark stroke trials to older adults.",1
Older adults must interpret the evidence base for primary and secondary stroke prevention with caution.,1
"Numerous patient-specific factors, including comorbidities, frailty, independence level, and polypharmacy, are significantly associated with differential outcomes of these interventions.",1
"This paper examines current guidelines and evidence in clinical literature about medical management, lifestyle modifications, and psychosocial interactions that contribute to preventing stroke in older adults.",1
Treatment of modifiable risk factors in elderly patients is critical to risk prevention strategies that aim to reduce the incidence of ischemic stroke in this vulnerable patient population.,1
The exclusion of geriatric patients from the landmark and ongoing clinical trials of acute ischemic stroke treatment has resulted in an insufficient evidence base for this growing old cohort.,1
"The comorbidity burden of geriatric patients is complex and substantially different than that of younger patients.7,8 In a retrospective single-center cross-sectional study of 1457 stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients, comorbidities, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, and previous stroke/TIA, were significantly higher in elderly patients (³80 years) compared to their younger counterparts.5 In contrast, the prevalence of hyperlipidemia was not different, and diabetes and smoking rates were significantly lower in the advanced-age patient sample.",1
"Primary and secondary prevention strategies in the geriatric population directly address the distinct risk profile, comorbidity burden, and age-related stroke pathophysiology that differentiate these patients from their younger counterparts.",1
"Medical management for elderly patients is often complicated by polypharmacy and tolerability concerns regarding multi-drug regimens standard in the very elderly population.9,10 The anticholinergic burden and other polypharmacy considerations associated with the therapeutic agents used for stroke risk reduction may outweigh any potential morbidity or mortality benefit that medical management may yield.6 For surgical carotid interventions, patient-specific factors, including age, mediate the magnitude of the protective effect associated with these preventative procedures.11 Age-independent determination of frailty has been identified as a better predictor of stroke outcomes than age alone,6,12 suggesting that a comprehensive risk assessment strategy encompassing a patientÕs global functional status may better guide stroke risk modification for very elderly patients, including therapeutic initiation, continuation, or modification.",1
"Hypertension has the highest population-attributable risk percentage for stroke and is one of the most critical modifiable risk factors in frail and elderly patients.1,6,13 The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) indicated that blood pressure reduction significantly benefited patients over 80.",1
"While a meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive agents in patients ³ 80 years demonstrated that treatment with blood-pressure-lowering agents significantly reduced stroke risk in this patient segment, HYVET was the only included trial to indicate a mortality benefit of medical hypertension management.14,15 This finding may be reconciled with the strict exclusion criteria of HYVET, as patients with accelerated and secondary hypertension, heart failure, electrolyte derangements, and advanced care needs were excluded.1,16 The more recent SPRINT trial provided corroborating evidence for antihypertensive use in aged patients ³ 75 years, also demonstrating that a significant stroke reduction and mortality benefit was not limited to younger patients.17,18 When contextualized with other RCTs with more permissive inclusion criteria, such as the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension)19 and the European Working Party on High blood pressure in the Elderly (EWPHE)20, the antihypertensive agent used in both ambulatory patients ³ 80 and the frail elderly population has demonstrated significant reductions in stroke risk compared to placebo.",1
"However, mortality benefits may be limited to patients with better functional status and less severe comorbidities.1,14 Time to benefit and absolute risk reduction must be considered with life expectancy and quality of life concerns in the elderly when identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from medical management.",1
A meta-analysis of nine primary prevention stroke trials identified that more intensive hypertension treatment for 200 elderly patients prevents one additional stroke after 1.7 years of treatment.21 This time to benefit was sensitive to the baseline systolic blood pressures across the included studies.,1
Patients with blood pressure below 150 mmHg were likely to have more time to benefit than 1.7 years compared to patients with baseline systolic pressures above 190 mmHg.,1
The Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial randomized 4695 patients to treatment with 10-40 mg daily nitrendipine +/- 5-20 mg daily enalapril and 12.5-25.0 mg daily hydrochlorothiazide or matching placebos and demonstrated that active treatment reduced the total stroke rate by 42% (p=0.003) and non-fatal stroke rate by 44% (p=0.007).,1
"Only patients > 60 were included in the trial, with an average age of 70 in both the treatment and placebo arms.22 Age was a significant predictor of mortality.",1
The treatment-by-age interaction term was significant for overall mortality (p=0.009).,1
"It was approaching significance for cardiovascular mortality (p=0.09), suggesting that the treatment benefit was lost after approximately 75 years of age.23 The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial investigated the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension with a stepped-care therapy regimen of chlorthalidone and atenolol and found reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with a 5-year benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants.",1
"Like Syst-Eur, the trial only included patients over 60 with a mean participant age of 72 years.24 The PROGRESS trial provides further guidance on hypertension management in the elderly for secondary prevention.1 While a target blood pressure goal of <160 mmHg is applicable for primary prevention, more aggressive blood pressure lowering may be beneficial in the secondary prevention setting.",1
"At a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, recurrent stroke events were less common in the 4 mg perindopril ± indapamide treatment arm versus placebo (10% vs.",1
"14%; RRR 28%; 95% Cl 17Ð38%, p < 0.0001), although there was no mortality difference between the groups.25 While the average age of 64 years does limit the generalizability of the findings to very elderly geriatric patients,1 a more recent age-stratified meta-analysis of RCTs of hypertension management for secondary prevention indicated that the overall magnitude of risk reduction for patients receiving antihypertensives compared to controls (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98, I2=49%) did not differ between the < 80 and ³ 80 age subgroups, although there was a significantly higher risk of hypotensive symptoms in the ³ 80 strata (RR, 2.17 95% CI: 1.22, 3.86, I2 =0%).26 Aging-related physiological changes such as reduced baroreceptor response and arterial remodeling may mediate the higher likelihood of iatrogenic symptomatic hypotension in older adults,26 however the preventative benefit of antihypertensives in this population has been corroborated, and the antihypertensive selection and initiation following a stroke should be tailored to patient-specific risk factors, polypharmacy considerations, and tolerability concerns.1 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a more common risk factor for ischemic stroke as geriatric patients age.",1
"1,27,28 In the Oxford Vascular Study, approximately one-third of patients aged ³ 80 years with known AF were not treated with anticoagulation, indicating a substantial unmet need in this growing patient segment.29 The Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) trial studied elderly patients (³75 years) with AF.",1
"It demonstrated that warfarin (target INR 2Ð3) outperformed 75 mg aspirin daily for an event rate of stroke, arterial embolism, or other intracranial hemorrhages with an absolute annual risk reduction of 2% (95% CI: 0.7-3.2, p = 0.003).30 In contrast, the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial compared 81-324 mg daily aspirin to 5 mg twice daily apixaban.31 Subgroup analysis of AVERROES trial data indicated that the relative reduction in stroke or systemic embolism with apixaban versus aspirin therapy was more pronounced in patients aged ³ 75 years (HR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20Ð0.54) compared to those <75 years (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.39Ð0.98).",1
"Still, it was not significantly different (p=0.06).",1
"However, the relative reduction in the same primary outcome was significantly more significant for individuals ³ 85 years (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.02Ð0.48) versus <85 (HR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35Ð0.69; p-value for age interaction = 0.05).",1
This age stratification suggests that a direct oral anticoagulant's superiority over aspirin may differ as geriatric patient ages.,1
"There was no significant difference in the event rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleed between the younger and older subsamples, whether using the 75- or 85-year cutoff.",1
"Patients in the ³ 75-year age group are classified as high-risk based on the CHA2DS2VASc scoring system on age alone, thereby complicating therapeutic management with anticoagulation in the presence of other complicating comorbidities, lifestyle factors, or contraindications.1,32 Increased bleeding risk is a critical consideration when weighed against the increased stroke risk as populations age, as a fall risk and polypharmacy considerations need to be accounted for when making recommendations for very elderly patients.",1
"In their study of AF patients in the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, Friberg et al.33 found that the adjusted net clinical benefit of anticoagulation with warfarin was higher for almost all AF patients except for those with shallow risk of ischemic stroke (CHA2DS2VASc = 0) or a moderately elevated bleeding risk as measured by the HAS-BLED scoring system highlighting the critical interaction between anticoagulation and bleeding risk tradeoff in clinical decision making for elderly.34 The elderly are at increased risk of embolic stroke after the first occurrence.35 A meta-analysis of patients from the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (CAST) and the International Student Trial (IST) studies demonstrates that the benefit of aspirin treatment in early secondary prevention of stroke in the in-hospital setting has no significant interaction with age, with a similar positive impact of antiplatelet therapy in patients ³75 years, 65-74 years, and < 64 years cohorts.36 When looking beyond the two-to-four-week time window examined in the CAST and IST trials, the degree of benefit of antiplatelet therapy in reducing stroke recurrence is approximately the same as at a one-year follow-up.1,36 Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel for secondary prevention demonstrates a time-course relationship similar to aspirin monotherapy.",1
"Analysis of the time course benefit of DAPT in the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trials indicates that the protective effect against major ischemic events, a composite measure including ischemic stroke, primarily occurs in the first 21 days of treatment with no substantial benefit at 90 days.37 Similarly, the Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial demonstrated the clinical benefit of DAPT for 21 days versus aspirin monotherapy, with 3.5% and 3.4% absolute risk reduction in subsequent strokes at three months and one year respectively.38 However, the mean age of patients in CHANCE was 62 years, and the median age in the POINT trial was 65 years, which may have limited generalizability to elderly segments of the geriatric population.",1
"A recent meta-analysis of seven multi-center RCTs focused on the age-specific effects of DAPT demonstrated that dual therapy was superior to aspirin monotherapy in patients ³65 years (RR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69-0.91, p=0.001), but not clopidogrel monotherapy in terms of reducing recurrent stroke (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93-1.10; p = 0.80).39 However, DAPT was associated with increased significant intracranial bleeding.39 Follow-up periods across the included studies ranged from 30 days to 3.7 years.",1
"Overall, data across landmark antiplatelet trials and analyses have not provided evidence for a preferred antiplatelet regimen for very elderly patients.",1
"While proton-pump inhibitor therapy has been recommended with aspirin therapy to minimize gastric side effects,1,27 there are PPI-specific concerns (electrolyte derangements, kidney injury, dementia, C.",1
"difficile infection, bone fracture)40 and polypharmacy considerations1 that need to be tailored to patient-specific needs.",1
"Regarding age-specific considerations, therapeutic selection is also relevant.",1
"For example, dipyridamole, a controlled-release antiplatelet agent included in recommendations, has hypotensive effects that may increase fall risk in the very elderly population.1 There has been mixed evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering agents in primary stroke prevention in the elderly.",1
"The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention (JUPITER) trial was an RCT that compared 20 mg rosuvastatin to placebo with normal-to-low LDL-C levels, elevated hsCRP values, and without diabetes or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.41 Pre-specified subgroup analysis of the elderly population (70-97 years) demonstrated that statin treatment significantly reduced stroke occurrence over two years (ARR = 0.6%, p=0.023) in primary prevention and lowered a composite metric of MI, stroke, and death versus placebo.42 In contrast, the PROSPER study of primary prevention with daily 40 mg pravastatin therapy did not reduce the risk of fatal or non-fatal stroke at an average follow-up of 3.2 years (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.81-1.31, p=0.81).43 Regarding all-cause mortality in the primary preventative setting, there was no significant decrease in mortality in the PROSPER or the elderly sample of JUPITER.42Ð44 The PROSPER trial was designed to specifically select elderly patients (mean age 75, 70-82 years) that were not frail compared to JUPITER, with its broader range of patient ages with stricter exclusion criteria and shorter follow-up period.",1
The generalizability of both of these studies to patients of advanced age is constrained by trial design.,1
The exclusion of frail patients and follow-up period may be less relevant to the elderly population.,1
"For secondary stroke prevention, the PROSPER study demonstrated no significant difference in fatal or non-fatal stroke occurrence (ARR = 0.02, p=0.84).42Ð44 In contrast, Afilalo et al.45 indicated a 25% relative reduction in stroke in their meta-analysis of nine statin trials (RR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 Ð 0.94).",1
"However, the mean patient age was under 70 years in their study.45 The SPARCL trial, which examined stroke recurrence in patients with prior TIA or stroke, demonstrated a significant reduction in their composite measure of a fatal and non-fatal stroke at five-year follow-up (1.9% at five years, p = 0.03).46,47 However, when stratified in younger (< 65 years) and older ( ³ 65 years) subgroups, a test of heterogeneity for an interactive effect between age status and treatment was not significant.46,47 Statin treatment initiation in elderly patients should account for non-age frailty parameters, such as those captured in frailty assessment tools such as the Fried Model or the Clinical Frailty Scale, to determine whether preventative lipid-lowering medical management outweighs safety, tolerability, and quality-of-life concerns associated with statin therapy.44 Carotid endarterectomy (CEA), stenting, and angioplasty are interventional options for primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.",1
"Based on 2021 European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines, CEA is recommended in patients with ³ 60Ð99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis that is determined to be at risk on best medical treatment.48 The guidelines recommended CEA for patients with symptomatic stenosis ³70Ð99% and suggested CEA for symptomatic patients with 50Ð69% stenosis.",1
"Carotid artery stenting (CAS) can be considered in patients < 70 years with symptomatic stenosis ³ 50-99%.48 The clinical practice guidelines released by Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) in 2021 indicate treatment for symptomatic low-risk surgical patients with 50-99% stenosis and asymptomatic patients with 70-99%.49 The guidelines indicate that for patients with recent stable stroke (Modified Rankin scale of 0-2), revascularization is appropriate for patients with >50% stenosis and should ideally be performed as soon as the patient is neurologically stable (>48 hrs but <14 days after onset).49 For primary prevention in elderly patients ( ³ 80 years) with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis, Ballotta et al.",1
(2015) indicate that CEA with the best medical therapy had significantly higher rates of freedom at five years for cerebral ischemic events (98% vs.,1
84%; p = 0.04) and plaque progression (100% vs.,1
"79%; p = 0.01) compared to patients who had best medical therapy alone, although there was no significant mortality difference (66% vs.",1
"68%; p =0.65).50 The authors also identified minimal peri-operative complications or morbidity in this octogenarian cohort of 123 patients, with an isolated case of perioperative TIA, two incidences of iatrogenic nerve injury, and a single case of neck hematoma requiring surgical intervention.",1
"For secondary prevention, a meta-analysis of the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) and North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) trials demonstrated that old age is not an absolute contraindication for endarterectomy.1,51 A retrospective cohort study of the Carotid Artery Revascularization and Endarterectomy registry indicated a significant trend with increasing age for a composite rate of in-hospital death, stroke, and myocardial infarction highest in the age ³ 85 years group.48,52,53 In asymptomatic patients, the mortality rate was significantly higher in the ³ 75 years sample versus the <75 years group (0.7% vs.",1
"0.0%; p = 0.006), however, the composite measure of perioperative morbidity and mortality was not significantly different between the groups (3.1% vs. 2.0%; p=0.08).",1
The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs.,1
"Stenting Trial (CREST) demonstrated a significant age interactive term with procedural efficacy of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy, with stenting favored for patients aged less than approximately 70 years and endarterectomy more effective for patients > 70 years (p=0.02).11,54 Plaque length was identified as a significant mediator of the higher risk of stroke and death in elderly patients in CREST,11 however it only accounted for 8% of the increased risk in this patient cohort, suggesting that there are other patient or laboratory factors excluded from the analysis that may explain differential outcomes between stenting and endarterectomy in very elderly patients.",1
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 CEA studies from January 1, 1980, through March 1, 2022 that assessed post-CEA outcomes determined that perioperative death was significantly higher in octogenarians versus non-octogenarians (1.09% vs.",1
"0.53%; p < 0.001), and when analyzing five-year age cohorts subgroups, there was a significant linear increase in perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.55 Survival and 5-year stroke rate were not significantly different between the two groups.",1
"The ideal timing of CEA for preventing stroke recurrence is within two weeks of the initial event, with no substantial benefit three months following an ischemic stroke or TIA.56,57 Early screening within days of confirmed TIA or ischemic stroke with an actual carotid territory event may be ideal for older adults to optimize the secondary prevention benefit of CEA, with CAS as an alternative for those unable to tolerate endarterectomy.49 The evidence base demonstrates the clinical benefits of carotid interventions in elderly patients, including lower stroke recurrence rates.",1
"However, these must be weighed against patient-specific factors associated with increased perioperative complications and mortality.",1
Primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in older adults includes modification of behavioral and lifestyle factors.,1
"Data from longitudinal studies have shown that some of the most significant lifestyle interventions to reduce the risk of stroke include regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet, and smoking cessation or reduction.",1
"It has been demonstrated that even a modest improvement in lifestyle factors can be protective against ischemic stroke.58,59 Stroke incidence has been linked to a lack of physical activity.",1
"Conversely, a range of activities-related behaviors has been associated with stroke prevention.",1
"Physical activity resulting in reduced stroke incidence constitutes various types, frequencies, duration, and intensities.60 The literature suggests that any physical activity, even occupational and leisure time, reduces stroke risk.",1
"However, moderate to vigorous physical activity is necessary for men to maximize the protective benefits against stroke.",1
"In contrast, longer-duration activities of low to moderate intensity are generally more beneficial for women.61 Frequent activity, occurring daily or every other day, is deemed most protective against stroke.60 Diet is associated with stroke risk.",1
"It is well-documented that healthy eating choices exert a beneficial protective effect on reducing stroke risk, including hypertension, diabetes, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and obesity.62 In particular, adherence to the Mediterranean Diet(MeD) pattern is a potent tool in this regard, suggesting causality; the higher the adherence to MeD, the lower the risk of stroke.62 The key elements characterizing the MeD pattern are as follows: abundant plant foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds); minimally processed, seasonally fresh, and locally grown foods; olive oil as the principal source of dietary lipids; red meat in low frequency and amounts; fish and poultry in moderate amounts; wine in low-to-moderate amounts.63 Longitudinal studies such as the NursesÕ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study establish a linear relationship between greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, rich in flavonoids and antioxidants, to lower stroke risk.59 Smoking is a preventable risk factor for ischemic stroke and, as such, warrants a high priority in the management of stroke risk.",1
"It is estimated that as many as 25% of all strokes can be attributed to smoking.64 Multiple studies have concluded that cigarette smoking is a significant independent contributor to stroke, with smokers increasing stroke risk by 50% compared to the risk status for non-smokers.59 Further, there is evidence that second-hand smoke increases the risk of stroke even in non-smokers and that this risk is associated with the intensity and duration of environmental exposure.64,65 Smoking cessation significantly reduces stroke risk starting the first year after quitting, but studies do not conclusively demonstrate a total return to non-smoker risk levels.59,65 The dose-response relationship between tobacco consumption and stroke risk implies that reducing the daily number of cigarettes smoked reduces stroke risk.65 Stroke has many risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and coronary and peripheral artery disease, just to name a few.",1
"A critical lens to look through in the possible risk reduction of stroke is psychosocial interactions such as depression, social pressures, smoking, etc.",1
This allows for the potential to look at aspects of individuals' lives that increase their risk of developing a stroke.,1
"An important question to ask, therefore, is what psychological or social factors produce behaviors that lead to these risk factors that contribute to stroke?",1
The literature on the association between depressive symptoms and stroke has been inconsistent.,1
"Some articles have concluded no relation between depressive symptoms and stroke, while others have found that baseline depressive symptoms predict the risk of stroke incidence.66Ð70 We know that depression HAS been associated with increased rates of cardiovascular disease and that depression is prevalent among elderly populations.71 A 2007 prospective study showed that depressive symptoms were associated with a 4-fold increased risk of stroke/TIA in men and women <65 years of age but not in ages 65+, showing evidence of an association between depression and stroke risk.71 Another study found that participants with depressive symptoms had a 31% higher rate of subsequent cardiovascular events than those without depressive symptoms.72 Cardiovascular events were heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or death.",1
"Interestingly, it was found that when they adjusted for physical activity and Òother health behaviors,Ó there was no significant association between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular events.72 This observation may explain why depressive symptoms affect cardiovascular events such as stroke.",1
"Patients with depressive symptoms are more likely to be inactive, smoke, and not adhere to a healthy diet, all of which are associated with increased hypertension, a stroke risk factor.59,72 Previous longitudinal studies have demonstrated that there may be some correlation between individuals' home life and their risk for developing coronary heart disease (CHD), a risk factor for stroke.",1
"In one particular study, researchers analyzed whether various aspects of marital strain may be significantly related to the development of CHD.73 Although significant components of marital strain, such as marital happiness and amount of disagreements, did not significantly relate to the development of CHD, it was found that men who reported that their wives work disrupted their home life were 2.7 times more likely to develop CHD over a ten-year follow-up.73 Although the mechanism is unknown, it is hypothesized that this is due to the husband's feeling of inadequacy in failing to serve his wife's ÒprotectorÓ role.",1
Stroke risk modification strategies for the elderly have compounding and overlapping effects mediating a patientÕs likelihood of having a primary or recurrent ischemic stroke.,1
"Lifestyle modifications, behavioral and psychosocial interventions, and medical or surgical management have a defined role in the primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke for patients at risk.",1
"However, the evidence base specifying these risk modification strategies in the elderly can be inconsistent and incomplete.",1
"Patient-specific considerations must be considered when selecting preventative measures, including the magnitude of frailty, level of independence, comorbidity burden, and polypharmacy.",1
"Patient-specific considerations must be considered when selecting preventative measures, including the magnitude of frailty, level of independence, comorbidity burden, and polypharmacy.",1
Significant unmet needs exist in translating trial data into clinical guidelines and recommendations for elderly patients.,1
"Recommendations and guidelines for the use of medical, psychosocial, or lifestyle interventions often involve the generalization of findings from RCTs with patient samples that are not representative of real-world clinical profiles of very elderly patients.",1
Future trial designs of stroke studies that examine primary or secondary prevention should have well-reasoned upper age limits and inclusion/exclusion criteria that account for the complex interactive factors associated with very elderly patients with elevated stroke risk.,1
"Over-and under-treatment of patients that diverges from the existing evidence base for stroke prevention in the elderly may be associated with extreme adverse events and avoidable morbidity and mortality.1 Moving forward, developing clinical recommendations for very elderly patients should incorporate higher quality evidence from studies that are sufficiently powered with older geriatric patients and are designed appropriately better to represent real-world risk profiles in this growing patient demographic.",1
"Ischemic stroke is one of the most significant health risks facing the elderly, causing substantial morbidity and mortality.",1
"It is a significant cause of disability and can lead to long-term complications, such as cognitive decline and decreased independence.",1
"As the global population ages, developing effective strategies for monitoring risk and preventing ischemic stroke in older adults becomes increasingly important.",1
"The incidence of ischemic stroke increases exponentially with age, and those aged 65 and older are at the highest risk.",1
The likelihood of suffering an ischemic stroke doubles every decade after age 55.,1
"Moreover, older adults are more likely to experience severe strokes, increasing disability and mortality rates.",1
Effective prevention of ischemic stroke in older adults begins with identifying and managing modifiable risk factors.,1
Regularly monitoring the aforementioned risk factors can help healthcare providers identify high-risk individuals and initiate appropriate interventions.,1
"Proper management of hypertension, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, can reduce the risk of stroke by up to 40%.",1
Elevated blood pressure is the most significant modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke.,1
"Blood pressure should be monitored regularly in older adults, and treatment targets should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and frailty status.",1
"Next, atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke by five times.",1
"Early detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation, including anticoagulation therapy, can substantially reduce the risk of stroke.",1
"Healthcare providers should screen for atrial fibrillation through pulse palpation and electrocardiogram (ECG) during routine checkups, especially in older adults with known risk factors.",1
Poor glycemic control is associated with an increased risk of stroke.,1
"Older adults with diabetes should be monitored closely to ensure proper management of blood glucose levels, including regular hemoglobin A1c testing.",1
"A multifaceted approach, including dietary modifications, physical activity, and medication, can help control diabetes and reduce stroke risk.",1
"Furthermore, high cholesterol levels contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of ischemic stroke.",1
"Regular lipid screening and appropriate management, including statin therapy when indicated, can help lower the risk of stroke in older adults.",1
"In addition to managing modifiable risk factors, several evidence-based interventions can further reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in older adults.",1
"Smoking is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke, and quitting can substantially reduce the risk.",1
"Healthcare providers should encourage older adults to quit smoking and offer assistance through counseling, pharmacological interventions, or referral to smoking cessation programs.",1
"Regular physical activity has decreased the risk of stroke by improving cardiovascular health, blood pressure control, and weight management.",1
"Older adults should be encouraged to engage in age-appropriate, low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or gentle yoga.",1
"A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help lower the risk of stroke by reducing blood pressure, cholesterol, and inflammation.",1
"Healthcare providers should promote the adoption of a heart-healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, in older adults.",1
"While moderate alcohol consumption may have some cardiovascular benefits, excessive intake can increase the risk of stroke.",1
"Older adults should be advised to limit their alcohol intake, following the guidelines of no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.",1
Sleep disturbances and chronic stress can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and stroke risk.,1
"Healthcare providers should assess and address sleep and stress-related issues in older adults, recommending cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, or referral to specialists when appropriate.",1
"Ultimately, the prevention of ischemic stroke in the elderly population is a crucial public health priority.",1
"By proactively monitoring and managing risk factors and promoting evidence-based interventions, healthcare providers can play a pivotal role in reducing the incidence and impact of stroke in older adults.",1
A multifaceted approach that addresses individual and population-level factors is necessary to achieve meaningful progress in stroke prevention.,1
"Our responsibility as healthcare professionals is to remain vigilant and dedicated to this cause, as the well-being of our aging population depends on it.",1
"My brother, Sashka, ran away from home when he was fifteen years old.",1
It is not quite right to say he ran away from home; our home deserted us.,1
"When Sashka disappeared, strictly speaking, there was nowhere to run from nor to return to.",1
Our home was one of approximately four million homes foreclosed in the U.S.,1
during the subprime mortgage crisis of the aughts.,1
Our mother expected her four children who were fifteen and older to make their own way.,1
That we did.,1
It was 2008.,1
"I was then a 19-year-old philosophy student at Hunter College, CUNY and Sashka, a high-school junior.",1
It would not be until April of 2024Ñ16 years laterÑthat Sashka and I would meet again.,1
"By then, he would be a married father of two small children living in a Brooklyn neighborhood close to where we grew up and lost each other, and I, a philosophy professor in northern California.",1
The foreclosure took two homes from us: it took our physical shelter and it dissolved our family unit.,1
Home became an idea I would spend years mourning and striving after.,1
I thought IÕd never see my brother again.,1
"In reconnecting, we now share the burden of trying to explain what happened to our family.",1
"I reconciled myself to my brotherÕs absence not with the acceptance that comes after mourning, but as if he had never existed at all.",1
His features dissolved into basic shapes and colors.,1
"I couldnÕt stomach looking at our childhood photographs until the spring of 2024, when Sashka returned to me.",1
Our familyÕs story is but one of millions of untold stories of foreclosure.,1
"Yet, American popular cultureÑfilms, novels, theater, television programsÑhas ignored the housing crisis, as it was experienced by ordinary Americans.",1
News reports neglected to convey the experiences of the people who were directly affected by it; they still do.,1
"Public discussion of the crisis, if it happens at all, comes across like a sterile intellectual exercise, bloated with the technical jargon of the financial world.",1
"As a teenager, I felt ashamed that I couldnÕt understand why my family had lost our home.",1
That feeling stuck with me until I wrote this piece.,1
"Writing is an assertion that one is not a plaything of the cosmos too dumb to follow the narrative, like Job plundered by godÕs inexplicable wager with the devil.",1
"American popular cultureÑfilms, novels, theater, television programsÑhas ignored the housing crisis, as it was experienced by ordinary Americans.",1
"With SashkaÕs reappearance in my life, I feel empowered to confront our past.",1
And to raise the timeless questions that have troubled the souls of philosophers: Why must the innocent suffer?,1
Why must the rich rob the poor?,1
Who will make it up to us?,1
Sashka and I must learn to take stock of losses for which we are not responsible.,1
"And we must learn, as Aristotle puts it, to feel the right feelings at the right time in the right way.",1
"A cow moos, a goat bleats, and a chicken screams when it is in pain.",1
The human animal alone learns to pass over in silence the destruction of its life.,1
"In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevsky warns, ÒWe humans can get used to anything, villains that we are!Ó As I learn to resist my own silent resignation, I offer this piece in lieu of a scream 16 years overdue.",1
"My mother arrived in New York City in 1989 as a refugee during Perestroika, a period of political and economic restructuring of the Soviet Union.",1
"In Russian, the word Perestroika (___________) means ÒRebuilding.Ó Just prior to its collapse, the Soviet Union introduced free market reforms and permitted the emigration of ethnic and religious minorities.",1
An exodus of hundreds of thousands followed.,1
"My mother had a Jewish mother and an ethnic Uyghur father, a Uyghur nationalist who grew up in an orphanage in Kazakhstan.",1
"After my mother finished the Moscow State University with a degree in French in the mid-1980s, she petitioned the refugee-resettlement organization The Hebrew International Aid Society (HIAS) to sponsor her emigration case.",1
"My fatherÕs parting gift was paying for a Ôpaper marriageÕ to a stranger my mother met once, on their wedding day, to strengthen her petition before Soviet authorities.",1
"(My father was already married to someone else and had children.) She left Russia pregnant with me and travelled alone through Europe, awaiting news from HIAS about which country would grant her residency.",1
I was born while she waited in Vienna.,1
Austria had not granted us residency.,1
"In the space reserved for nationality, my birth certificate identifies me as stateless; and my mother gave me the strangerÕs last name to keep up the charade of her marriage.",1
"I was born Elvira Isayeva, not Basevich.",1
"One of my favorite Russian sayings is, ÒLaugh through tears!Ó (____ ______ _____!).",1
"Greetings, the Isayeva family, thank you for your enterprising spiritÑselling your family nameÑin my hour of need.",1
"I was eventually given my fatherÕs last name after we settled in America, safe from the scrutiny of my motherÕs indiscretions by the collapsing Soviet Union.",1
HIAS obtained an American green card and a welfare card for us.,1
"We arrived in September 1989 and moved to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where immigrants with similar backgrounds settled.",1
My motherÕs first impression of the city was that sheÕd never seen so many homeless people.,1
She had no inkling that it was a harbinger of things to come.,1
"Though she didnÕt have faith in the American dream, she did not expect to see visible poverty, much less her own eventual descent into housing insecurity.",1
"Desperate for employment, she joined a minority of women driving a yellow taxicab for a living, but never adjusted to the brutal transition from being an ambitious student at the top of her class to driving a yellow cab for tips.",1
"She had three more children in America, a son and two daughters.",1
Her hope for us was that weÕd turn out fine.,1
"Not excellent, not great, but just fine.",1
"ÒLetÕs be like normal people,Ó sheÕd say.",1
"We watched AmericaÕs Funniest Home Videos, ate fat Russian sausages in hot dog buns and slowly lost our native tongue.",1
I assumed responsibility for my siblingsÕ care.,1
"I loved grocery shopping, impressing my siblings with my haul eked out of a WIC check and $20 bill.",1
"They squealed with joy as I pulled out Little Debbies, Lunchables, Capri-Sun, and huge Ôfamily-sizeÕ bags of potato chips.",1
We didnÕt own a camera.,1
Our childhood photographs were snapped by a distant relative who had collected barcodes from discarded packs of Marlboro cigarettes.,1
"Along with numerous American companies, such as General Mills cereal and McDonalds, in the Ô90s Marlboro offered rewards for high consumption.",1
My relative didnÕt smoke; it was a long process of rifling through garbage on the streets and mailing barcodes to procure a camera.,1
"My mother believed that her crowning achievement as a first-generation immigrant was buying a home in the affluent neighborhood of Manhattan Beach, nestled between Sheepshead Bay and Brighton Beach.",1
The bank approved a subprime mortgage for her for a house valued at over a million dollars.,1
"Yet, her annual earnings as a cab driver put us in an income bracket shared by some of the poorest families in NYC.",1
"In fact, I received aid reserved for the neediest college students, qualifying for both federal and city grants in CUNYÕs financial aid office.",1
Banks had simply stopped underwriting subprime mortgages to financially insecure borrowers who they knew wouldnÕt be able to pay off their loan.,1
My mother would eventually cash my student aid checks to fend off foreclosure.,1
Our time in Manhattan Beach was thus filled with absurd contradictions.,1
"Notwithstanding my pride in bringing home sugary snacks for my siblings, not having enough food was a constant source of anxiety.",1
The hot water was shut off in the wintertime.,1
"As property owners, we were responsible for filling the propane tank.",1
"When we got desperate, we heated water in pots on the stovetop and bathed in the tub, like Dickens characters.",1
This grotesque play-acting at being middle-class homeowners did not last long.,1
"By the spring of 2008, the bank began foreclosure proceedings, having pilfered enough of my motherÕs cabby earnings and my student aid checks.",1
I donÕt know how long my mother had gone without paying the mortgage.,1
"I suspect that if I wanted to, I could have applied for a subprime mortgage and bought the multi-million dollar house next door.",1
I could have joined the class of landed gentry if IÕd only thought to ask!,1
I was powerless to stop the dissolution of my family because a desperate and pleading love is not a currency with which you can pay the mortgage.,1
"Though she never outright said so, Sashka sensed my mother would not take him with her.",1
He stopped talking to both of us in the last months we all lived together in Manhattan Beach.,1
"A child abandoned by caregivers experiences the betrayal Òlike swallowing shards of broken glass,Ó as Sashka recently put it.",1
"ÒYouÕve got to be careful in your recollection of it because it can cut just as much coming up as going down.Ó When he disappeared, I convinced our mother to visit his high school to bring him back, but the dean said that he didnÕt want to see us.",1
I was powerless to stop the dissolution of my family because a desperate and pleading love is not a currency with which you can pay the mortgage.,1
"After SashkaÕs disappearance, our mother began hallucinating him, as the grieving sometimes see ghosts .",1
"ÒI canÕt look at them,Ó she once said, pointing to a group of children playing in the street.",1
The sight of little boys made her physically sick.,1
The first time I entered a toy store after the foreclosure I had a panic attack in an aisle lined with LEGO and Nerf guns.,1
"In his heart-rending memoir about facing criminal charges for writing poetry, Joseph Brodsky observed, ÒNo country has mastered the art of destroying its subjectsÕ souls as well as Russia.Ó As it turns out, America does a pretty good job, too.",1
"In the aughts, a wave of foreclosures swept the U.S.",1
"and triggered a global financial crisis, bankrupting private mortgage lenders and leading to the bailout of federal mortgage companies at taxpayersÕ expense and eventually an economic recession.",1
"But, at the heart of the crisis, are millions of ordinary, working-class families like my own who descended into financial ruin from which many have not recovered.",1
Homeownership is a coveted ideal; it remains the most reliable mechanism for building intergenerational wealth.,1
The financial sector preyed upon poor peopleÕs aspirations for upward mobility and defrauded us.,1
A subprime mortgage is a mortgage that lenders give to people they perceive to be high-risk borrowers.,1
"People might have bad credit, medical expenses, or be divorced.",1
Racial and gender biases played a huge role.,1
These groups were historically unable to qualify for a mortgage due to insufficient capital and low wages.,1
"In a tactic known as Òreverse redlining,Ó the sociologist Ruby Mendenhall observes that Òlending institutions targeted [É] low-income families of color for loansÓ who had been Òhistorically excludedÓ from homeownership.",1
"ÒBlack women have the highest levels of subprime loans of all groups; specifically, they are 256 percent more likely than white males to receive these types of loans.Ó Black and Latinx households of any economic standing were 1.6 times as likely to receive subprime mortgages than white borrowers.",1
"Subprime mortgages charge higher interest rates and impose spurious penalties; and the interest rate is subject to balloon over time, with the mortgage often becoming more expensive than the house it mortgaged.",1
The result is that even middle-class families with modest savings end up bankrupt.,1
Banks doled out subprime mortgages that were impossible to repay.,1
The accessibility of mortgages in the aughts was a byproduct of government deregulation of banking and financial industries.,1
"Passed by Congress in 1933 in an emergency session and signed into law by FDR, the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act had separated commercial from investment banking.",1
"The objective was to stop predatory lending practices, such as banks charging high interest on loans and reselling loans as financial commodities.",1
Deregulation of the Ô80s and Ô90s set the stage for the housing crisis.,1
"In 1980, Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, which eliminated caps on the interest rates that banks can charge on loans, meaning there was no external limit for how high interest rates on loans can climb.",1
The Glass-Steagall Act was repealed in 1999.,1
"This allowed banks to bundle mortgages and resell them as security commodities to financial investment firms, which, in turn, sold them off again.",1
The process of reselling was riddled with fraud.,1
"On the one hand, banks had a financial incentive to give more mortgages to increase their investment portfolio.",1
Banks hawked a lot more mortgages to a lot more poor people.,1
They exploded the number of subprime mortgages they offered.,1
"In effect, poor people became a new infinitely exploitable resource.",1
"Banks cajoled borrowers like my mom into signing mortgages they could not afford by waiving basic underwriting standards, which were supposed to certify a householdÕs financial stability.",1
"On the other hand, banks made their subprime mortgages seem like attractive commodities to financial investment firms by hiding their toxicity.",1
They protected themselves against the inevitable rash of mortgage defaults by reselling risky securities quickly.,1
The short-term profits were astronomical.,1
And the unpayable debts became someone elseÕs problem: that of other investment firms and future homeless people.,1
"Ironically, this was a case of the snake eating its own tail since commercial banks were also buying up mortgage securities as financial investments.",1
Laugh if youÕre not stifling tears.,1
"Banks cajoled borrowers like my mom into signing mortgages they could not afford by waiving basic underwriting standards, which were supposed to certify a householdÕs financial stability.",1
"While my family was hit hard by foreclosure, many were hit harder still.",1
Spiking unemployment rates and unaffordable housing continue to lead to an ever-worsening homelessness crisis in the U.S.,1
There is little public investment in affordable housing.,1
"People are still losing their homes to predatory lending practices stemming from the aughts with the resurrection of so-called Òzombie mortgages.Ó During the subprime mortgage crisis, families sometimes took out two subprime mortgages: one for the actual cost of the home and a second for the down payment.",1
"For the few families that managed to pay off one subprime loan, the second loan would Ôcome back from the dead,Õ engorged with interest, even though the bank had repeatedly assured them that the second loan had long been forgiven.",1
Families receive a foreclosure notice just as soon as they thought they had full home ownership.,1

"What I adore Is a bug that lives only one day, especially if It is a terrible day, a day of train derailment or Chemical lake or cop admits to cover-up, a day When no one thinks of anything else, least of all That bug.",1

"In recent years there has been a vibrant flourishing of interest in the Enlightenment philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632-1670), best known for the Ethics and the Theologico-Political Treatise.",1
"In this forum, four emerging critical voices walk with Spinoza, bringing him into dialogue with contemporary political and philosophical challenges.",1

Gil Morejn explores SpinozaÕs challenge to contemporary anarchism and reappraises his status in radical continental thought.,1
"Marie Wuth brings Spinoza into dialogue with Frantz Fanon on racial imaginaries, and on the power with which narratives and counter-narratives can become sources of emancipation.",1
"And finally Jack Stetter considers SpinozaÕs contribution to thinking about war and international relations, particularly at a moment of interlocking crises.",1
"In this special Forum for The Philosopher, we are here to think about Spinoza after politics, but I think we should begin at Spinoza with politics, Spinoza in politics, that is, SpinozaÕs contribution to politics.",1
"ThereÕs a good deal that has been written about SpinozaÕs far-sighted and elegant contributions to philosophy, including social and political philosophy.",1
"Spinoza, as the story has so often been told, was born into the Jewish community in Amsterdam at the centre of the Dutch Golden Age, but was persecuted and ejected from that community because of his suspected atheism.",1
"This ""prince of philosophers"", a phrase that even Bertrand Russell and Gilles Deleuze can agree on, privately and meekly developed a brand new metaphysics which turned Cartesian dualism inside out, in which God and Nature were equivalent, there is just one substance understood through various attributes like extension and ideas, and for whom all things in nature are singular modes or expressions of the all-encompassing power of the universe, from the smallest ""worm in the blood"" up to the ""face of the whole universe"".",1
"Over the last few decades, Spinoza is mainly taught for the Ethics, his main work on ontology, epistemology and the good life.",1
"In the usual framing, heÕs usually not an end-destination but another station along the route of early modern philosophy that begins with Descartes and ends with Kant.",1
"But in his time, and for some time after his death, he was best known for the Theologico-Political Treatise (or TTP), a work which scandalised contemporaries by debunking the authority of miracles, a century before David Hume, and for setting out a rigorous, uncompromising reading of biblical scripture and prophecy in strictly naturalistic and critical terms.",1
"While some of SpinozaÕs arguments against superstition and on the risks of public fear for creating the conditions of mass tyranny were guided by the Stoics, others carry the mark of his time.",1
And this is where we get back to the first question: what is SpinozaÕs contribution to politics?,1
"For some readers, it is democracy.",1
"While Spinoza was not the first thinker to argue for democratic republicanism in his native Dutch Republic, he went further by providing a philosophical justification by appeal to our common nature and power.",1
Democracy isnÕt merely about a given distribution of roles or an electoral system.,1
"For Spinoza, it is closest to our natural condition of equality.",1
"It supports and involves individuals to contribute their ideas and judgements, and willingly participate in the operations of the state through the advantage to all that follows from common participation.",1
"Other readers see Spinoza as a precursor to modern-day liberalism, for instance in his arguments for the freedom to philosophise, the toleration of dissent, and restrictions on ecclesiastical power.",1
A final approach to SpinozaÕs politics highlights its revolutionary and affective dimension.,1
"Although approaching Spinoza through different concepts, Antonio Negri, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and more recently Frdric Lordon, use SpinozaÕs Ethics as a basis for exploring the material conditions in which modern-day citizens dominated and degraded by capitalism might find ways to refuse and resist.",1
"What makes this reading different from those which focus on democracy is its awkwardness with, if not incompatibility with, SpinozaÕs claims elsewhere that freedom and security arise through the organised state.",1
"WeÕll explore this position in more depth in a moment, but I want to set out now my approach to SpinozaÕs politics.",1
"I am going to offer two positions which IÕll then defend, and weÕll use these to think through some of the challenges and new opportunities of using Spinoza, of adventuring with Spinoza.",1
"SpinozaÕs most significant contribution to politics is relationality, which is to say, the foregrounding of politics in human relations.",1
"So for me, SpinozaÕs most significant contribution to politics is relationality, which is to say, the foregrounding of politics in human relations.",1
Relationality is our life in common; it is how different individuals are shaped and constituted by their relations with others.,1
"These relations are often the primary source of our power and weakness, our joys and hopes and our sadnesses and fears.",1
"These are relations of interdependence, not independence.",1
"George Eliot, a keen reader of Spinoza, came to view society in terms of such a ""web"" or ""thread"" of relations, one that can be stitched together to become sources of public power and collective freedom, through principles of solidarity, mutual understanding and care Ð and care is where IÕm going.",1
"But these webs of relations can also become like a net which traps, stifles and crushes individuals, often marginalised individuals, or freedom-loving individuals in despotic societies.",1
Relationality is double-edged.,1
ThereÕs a good tradition of foregrounding politics in relationality.,1
"AristotleÕs book Politics roots the political order not in abstract ideas but in two important principles for Spinoza, as for the Stoics: firstly, our fundamental human nature as sociable animals; and second, our private and personal relations Ð husband-wife, master-slave Ð that build a hierarchical web from private to public.",1
"The Stoic philosopher Hierocles set out the idea of circles of obligation that extend outward, from close family to the city.",1
"WhatÕs interesting about SpinozaÕs approach to relationality is that it is not foregrounded on what a later time would call the nuclear family, or on unjust relations of inequality given the veneer of natural respectability like master and slave.",1
"For Spinoza, individuals realise together their capacity to reason and act through association and fellowship.",1
"These individuals could be friends, lovers, strangers, siblings, parent and child, whatever.",1
They are bound by two core principles for relationality.,1
"An understanding of human beings as modes of power, as expressions of power in their relations with others.",1
This is underpinned by what Spinoza called the conatus.,1
All things in existence Ð not just human beings; Spinoza is opposed to anthropocentrism Ð all things in existence are defined by the fact they strive to persist or persevere in their being.,1
"This is their conatus, their striving, though it is not a striving in the sense of a Òconscious endeavourÓ.",1
"A pebble strives to persist in being when it remains inert, just as when the tide picks it up on the shoreline and drags it into the sea.",1
But human beings experience this conatus as desire.,1
"Desire is our appetite to strive to persevere in our being accompanied with consciousness of that appetite Ð a layer of ideas, emotions and judgements about what is most conducive or habitual to our striving.And it is through our striving through which we act or are acted upon, through which we think for ourselves or have the ideas and judgements of others passively imprinted onto us.",1
"In other words, this core characteristic of nature, of human nature, is the measure of our power.",1
"The second core principle for relationality are the affects, which is the term Spinoza uses for emotions.",1
"Nowadays we think of emotions in terms of internal, subjective feelings, but, for Spinoza, the affects are mental and physical states or dispositions, through which we are disposed to act a certain way, usually under the influence of a prior experience or reflection upon it.",1
So we have two principles of relationality: human nature and the affects.,1
And Spinoza often refers to these as standards in his political thought.,1
"In the Political Treatise, his final and unfinished work, he refers in the first chapter to two authorities: to human nature as it is, not as we would like it to be, echoing Machiavelli; and to politics as a science of the affects, through which theyÕre understood like patterns of the weather.",1
"In the Ethics he uses similar phrasing, to understand the affects with the same rigor as if they were geometrical ""lines, planes or bodies"".",1
He proposes to subject them to the same critical scrutiny to ascertain their causes.,1
"And, like the Stoics, he proposes to use a model of nature as a standard by which to theorise about the good life.",1
"Hence in the TTP he refers politics back to nature, to a quasi-Hobbesian state of nature, but one in which individuals cooperate together out for mutual security and assistance, not merely to escape a war of all against all, exchanging one form of domination for another, but in pursuit of the ""common good"" and advantage of all.",1
And this can only be achieved through the organised political State (hereon capitalised to distinguish it from other uses of the term ÒstateÓ).,1
"Spinoza was aware of a tradition, perhaps going back to Diogenes the Cynic, and certainly in some Catholic thought, of viewing the organised State as itself an evil, even if a necessary evil.",1
"For this tradition, the State is a corruption or bastardisation of human nature, an alienation of human nature, as it was for Rousseau.",1
"Spinoza instead argues that it is through the State, the freedom of the State, that there becomes an organised structure for education, deliberation and executive action through which our relations with one another are strengthened and bound by a common mind towards increasing our mutual capacity to think and act as equals.",1
The Italian political philosopher Riccardo Caporali has an enlightening term for this.,1
"He calls the State a ""factory"" of powers, in that the good State, a democratic and free State, manages, harmonies and develops powers according to a naturalistic framework.",1
"Today our relationship to the State is strained by the spectres of global war, malignant AI, a collective failure to show solidarity, hospitality and care to peoples brutalised by genocidal wars, and rampant disinformation.",1
But all this sounds rather idealistic and unworldly.,1
"Today our relationship to the State is strained by the spectres of global war, malignant AI, a collective failure to show solidarity, hospitality and care to peoples brutalised by genocidal wars, and rampant disinformation.",1
"As societies become more internally complex and globally interconnected, as people become more educated and live longer, the State is needed to provide more protection and support for citizens.",1
"One could understand this as a new form of mutual security, comparable to the foundation of the civil State as Spinoza and Hobbes understood it.",1
"But it also raises challenging questions about our obligations to each other, as relations through one another.",1
"Returning to the two principles of relationality, human nature and the affects, IÕm interested in a Spinozian understanding of care, a politics of care.",1
"This would involve: a collective that isnÕt singular; Aacommonality that isnÕt exclusive, e.g.",1
"native-defined; a sense of self defined by connections, obligations and mutual aid.",1
"This would be a kind of ""transindividuality"", as tienne Balibar would call it, between individual and collective, but one directed towards a politics that fights for stronger connections, stronger institutions of community power and social infrastructure, towards a culture that values connection and community over the emancipated individual.",1
These arenÕt ideals.,1
"TheyÕll become brute necessities as our systems for providing and protecting social care need to change, and as more people across the world lose their homes and travel in search of shelter, for a place of hospitality.",1
And they ask difficult questions of our relationship to the State.,1
"But Spinoza wouldnÕt accept a deflated realism or fatalism about the coercion of State structures: if freedom is arrived at through the democratic State, then that freedom also holds the promise of what Alexandre Matheron, one of the best readers of Spinoza, calls, a ""communism of minds"": interdependent, pluralistic, harmonised but not homogeneous.",1
"Finally, for now, it means turning back to a phrase Spinoza uses in the Ethics, that our power is in affecting others and being affected as much as possible.",1
"That, as Proposition 38 of Part IV goes, ""Whatever so disposes the human Body that it can be affected in a great many ways, or renders it capable of affecting external Bodies in a great many ways, is useful to man"".",1
The more we affect and are affected by others Ð our inter-affectivity Ð the more we can perceive and understand of the plurality of other human lives and experiences.,1
"And the more we become agents in those lives too, through which we come to live ""a truly human life"", as Spinoza says in the Political Treatise, rather than having mere existence imposed upon us.",1
Everybody seems to want a Spinoza of their own.,1
In the 18th century he was called a pantheist; in the 19th an atheist; in the 20th a materialist; in our own century he is said to be a vitalist.,1
"Sometimes these identifications are made in the mode of claiming him as a fellow-traveler or a predecessor; sometimes, by contrast, this is done in the mode of denouncing him as heretical, dangerous, or obviously wrong.",1
"It cannot be without interest that SpinozaÕs thought is somehow capable of receiving such conflicting and even contradictory interpretations, of inspiring as well as repelling such a wide variety of positions in the modern space of theoretical and practical reasons, but I will leave the question of why he invites such divergent readings aside.",1
"In SpinozaÕs case, though, it must be said that sometimes the kind of work required to make his thought commensurate with the philosophical and political sensibilities of the day goes beyond defensible hermeneutic charity, to the point of demonstrable distortion.",1
"In an article called ""Charitable Interpretations and the Political Domestication of Spinoza, or, Benedict in the Land of the Secular Imagination"", Yitzhak Melamed compellingly argues that we should be more skeptical about the contemporary practice of producing ""charitable interpretations"" of historical philosophers: perhaps instead of finding creative ways to explain away their obvious divergence from our own intuitions and beliefs, it would be better to let them retain their distance from us, which alone would make it possible for their thought to challenge those things we tend to take for granted today.",1
"Otherwise, we would be better off just saying what we think; if we are simply going to read our own intuitions into them, why bother reading them at all?",1
"Here I would like briefly to explore one such recent appropriation of Spinoza, and voice my objection that I think it is untenable.",1
"I have in mind the radical tradition in contemporary continental political philosophy, starting sometime in the 20th century, that could be described as anarchist or antinomian.",1
"The roots of these political-philosophical tendencies go back much farther than that, of course, but IÕd like to focus on this more recent trajectory.",1
"I do not have the space here to provide an adequate account of the existence and degree of influence of this tradition, so I will instead simply describe it by unpacking the two terms IÕm using to characterize it and give a few examples, and hopefully you will recognize what I am talking about.",1
"Anarchism is a political orientation characterized by its opposition to the State, or more generally its opposition to hierarchical concentrations of political power, whose imposition of certain norms of behavior is understood as being repressive, and typically as arbitrarily so.",1
"Closely related to this is antinomianism, meaning opposition to the law, or more generally opposition to normativity as such, which again is thought to be repressive or oppressive.",1
"My suggestion is that if you pick up any number of books in the continental tradition by thinkers like Foucault, Deleuze, Negri, Agamben or their many followers, you are likely to encounter this sort of anarchist or antinomian perspective: a generalized skepticism about or outright hostility to the State, to the law, or to the very notion of normativity.",1
"This is what I have in mind when I talk about there being at least a significant undercurrent in contemporary political philosophy that sees normativity and the state as fundamentally repressive, authoritarian, and antithetical to human freedom; from this perspective, these are things that need to be directly opposed or, perhaps, escaped from.",1
"My claim here is that SpinozaÕs thinking cannot be easily assimilated to these anarchist or antinomian modes of political thought, if it can be assimilated by them at all.",1
"But a good number of these thinkers have claimed Spinoza for themselves, as a kind of predecessor or precursor.",1
"Spinoza seeks to develop a science of politics, which for him means determining the governmental forms, institutions, and practices best suited to establish the conditions for maximal stability for any given mode of social organization.",1
"In my view, Spinoza seeks to develop a science of politics, which for him means determining the governmental forms, institutions, and practices best suited to establish the conditions for maximal stability for any given mode of social organization.",1
"In the Political Treatise, this means determining the optimal forms of monarchical, aristocratic, and Ð an effort unfortunately cut extremely short by his early death Ð democratic government.",1
But this of course presupposes that something like a government or a State is necessary.,1
"This, I argue, is exactly why he cannot be an anarchist or antinomian political thinker.",1
"Spinoza thinks that the immanent dynamics of human sociality are such that something like a state or government, with the ability to effectively enforce certain norms of behavior, is unavoidable, indeed necessary, and even desirable when properly understood, as soon as some number of human beings live together in a community.",1
"To put the claim in a somewhat exaggerated form, but one that I think can be defended, I would say that Spinoza thinks that a State spontaneously starts to form as soon as three people live together.",1
"(Of course, we tend to live in groups rather larger than that.) IÕll argue for this in three steps.",1
"First, human beings are for Spinoza fundamentally limited in their understanding.",1
"Most of our knowledge of things, including each other, is inadequate, partial, and confused.",1
"ItÕs true that the best thing in the world for us is to live with other human beings; a shared life in common with others is the condition for the possibility of our mutually increasing knowledge, power, and joy.",1
"But we mostly fail to understand this, and indeed we mostly fail to understand one another.",1
"Thus the second point: because of the general inadequacy of our knowledge, we tend to rely not on what we understand but what we imagine about one another, and this means that it is our affects that tend to most significantly shape our desires and determine how we act in respect of one another.",1
"Human beings are subject to passions, like fear, hope, and envy, and we are spontaneously imitative, emulating the affects of those around us.",1
"It is not because we rationally understand that society would benefit us, but rather out of our common fear and our common hope, that we generally strive to live together.",1
And this leads me to the third point.,1
"Once we live together in a community, it does not take very long for our common hopes and fears to come to bear on the same object: the power of all of us together.",1
That is because we quickly come to realize that this collective power is the most powerful thing with which we are familiar.,1
"This is the power of the multitude, potentia multitudinis.",1
"For Spinoza, sovereignty just is right defined by such a multitudeÕs power.",1
"When one of the members of a given society acts in ways that are imagined by the multitude to be contrary to the multitudeÕs perseverance in being, the multitude will do everything in its power to prevent that action; at the limit, it will strive to destroy that member if necessary.",1
"And this striving will be right, by definition, even if the threat posed by the member is only imaginary Ð for again, our knowledge is generally inadequate, and this does not in any way undermine the basis of sovereignty.",1
"In this way, without any rational reflection on the potential benefits of social life rather than living in the state of nature as in Hobbes, without any recourse to a social contract as in Rousseau, but rather just out of the immanent dynamics of human affect and sociality, we see the emergence of sovereignty, the formation of a State, and the establishment of norms of living in common enforced with threats of violence.",1
"To back up the interpretation I am laying out here, I want to provide only a single quote, and it is this, from the 2nd scholium to Proposition 37 of Part IV of the Ethics: Society can be maintained, provided it appropriates to itself the right everyone has of avenging himself, and of judging concerning good and evil.",1
"In this way Society has the power to prescribe a common rule of life, to make laws, and to maintain themÑnot by reason, which cannot restrain the affects, but by threats.",1
"This Society, maintained by laws and the power it has of preserving itself, is called a State, and those who are defended by its law, Citizens.",1
"Now I do not mean to suggest that all States are equally good, or that all norms or the ways that they are enforced are worth preserving.",1
"Without question, it is easy to come up with examples of both norms and modes of enforcement that we can all agree are extremely and needlessly harmful.",1
And the modern nation-state is obviously closely tied to settler-colonial and ethno-nationalist projects that deserve nothing but total abolition.,1
"I think, however, that Spinoza is right that this much is necessary: that the stable maintenance of a social formation is possible only in and through the establishment of some minimal set of norms for a common rule of life, some minimal set of laws, which can effectively be enforced only through threats of violence and at the limit by actual violence.",1
"For Spinoza, nothing happens in nature which can be attributed to any defect in it, and we can be far more powerful, understanding, and joyful together than apart.",1
"Perhaps this is indeed repressive, as the anarchists and antinomians say.",1
"And I am not in any way celebrating such repression, especially in those unfortunate cases where the violence enacted by the sovereign multitude is based on imaginary misunderstanding.",1
But Spinoza thinks that this minimal repression is unavoidable.,1
"In fact, within the social and institutional boundaries established by this minimal repression, the conditions for the possibility of human freedom are, for Spinoza, not negated, but fully preserved, as it is this same power of the multitude that can best maintain us in our existence and enable the common development of our powers of understanding.",1
"All of this is to say that, far from being a political thinker whose insights are neatly amenable to anarchist or antinomian projects, Spinoza in fact looks much more like a classical republican, in the mold of a Machiavelli, an orientation developed in recent times most influentially by Philip Pettit.",1
"On this score, Spinoza is a sober realist about our nature as finite thinking beings; he takes us for what we are in our concrete determination through the affects, and on this basis is made possible a genuine science of politics and freedom.",1
"To the poets, the romantics, and the satirists, he leaves them their utopian reveries and miserable dirges; let them bewail, or laugh at, or disdain, or curse human nature, he says.",1
"For Spinoza, nothing happens in nature which can be attributed to any defect in it, and we can be far more powerful, understanding, and joyful together than apart.",1
SpinozaÕs political treatises and his theory of affects and knowledge in the Ethics reveal the influential role of narratives in shaping communal life.,1
"Narratives, born of imagination, are crucial for orienting ourselves in the world and organizing coexistence Ð a fundamental political task.",1
"They structure time and space, and imbue meaning into past, present, and future, framing our experiences and shaping relationships with others, history, places, and institutions.",1
"Bringing Spinoza and Frantz Fanon into dialogue underscores the political potency of narratives, showcasing their power to include or exclude.",1
I will focus on this power in relation to race.,1
FanonÕs insights on racialization enhance our understanding of the significance of narratives in constructing and perpetuating oppressive societal structures.,1
"Spinoza and Fanon both illuminate the potential of narratives for both structural disempowerment and mutual, inclusive empowerment.",1
Narratives guide us through the world surrounding us.,1
"According to Spinoza in the Ethics, they are a bittersweet fruit of our imagination: the first of the three forms of knowledge that human beings can attain.",1
"In addition to our imagination, our understanding can take the form of reason and of intuition.",1
SpinozaÕs understanding of the imagination is based on the claim that the object of the human mind is the human body and that the human mind has an idea of the affections of the body.,1
This form of bodily awareness is knowledge of the imagination.,1
"In their book Collective Imaginings: Spinoza Past and Present, Moira Gatens and Genevieve Lloyd aptly describe the imagination as ""the coming together of mind and body in the most immediate way"".",1
"Of the three kinds of knowledge, imagination is most intimately intertwined with affections and experience.",1
"In Part II, Proposition 40 of the Ethics, Spinoza explains that we gain knowledge of the first kind ""from singular things which have been represented to us in a way that is confused and without order for the intellect"" and ""from signs, e.g., from the fact that, having heard or read certain things"".",1
The ideas of our imagination are images of our experiences and perceptions in past and present.,1
They capture the ways in which our body responds and connects to the world around us.,1
"In other words, when we imagine, we are thinking how we feel and experience ourselves together with others.",1
The ideas of our imagination are images of our experiences and perceptions in past and present.,1
They capture the ways in which our body responds and connects to the world around us.,1
"But, as Spinoza stresses in Proposition 41, ""to our imagination pertain all those ideas which are inadequate"".",1
The reason for this inadequacy is our affective relations and interactions.,1
"When we imagine, our ideas always involve more than the proper object of our mind, which is the human body.",1
They involve who and what affects us but in a confused and indistinct way.,1
"In this regard, our imagination coincides with our affects Ð our desires, joys and sadness Ð which indicate an increase or decrease in our power.",1
"In other words, the imagination is awareness of our needs and desires.",1
"It is key to learning about our relations and our power, which is why it is an invaluable part of our coexistence despite its inadequacy.",1
Central to the imagination are narratives.,1
"Narratives are stories and illustrations of the past, depictions of what we believe to have taken place or remember to have experienced.",1
"Indeed, remembering, illustrating, and representing are based on experience and are all activities of the imagination for Spinoza.",1
"Narratives provide an image of the past, which can, given their imaginative roots, only be incomplete and inadequate.",1
"However, they are of vital importance for understanding ourselves, our experiences, our relations and our place within the world.",1
Through narratives we can recollect the past and anticipate the future.,1
"The purpose of narratives, ultimately, is to guide by retelling illustrative deeds, by providing examples as encouragements or warnings; they shape the ways in which we navigate the world and the way we interact with others.",1
"Thus, narratives, as Michael Rosenthal has observed, are indispensable elements in the pursuit of both individual and collective desires and perseverance.",1
"In the TTP, Spinoza helps us understand this by demonstrating the persuasive force and socio-political impact of biblical narratives when he points to their influence on the way people organize their living together in communities.",1
"Narratives, Spinoza shows, are a means to create obedience and enforce laws.",1
"In more general terms, narratives create affective attachments and shape our affective relations.",1
Spinoza also portrays this in his retelling of the history of the Hebrew state in chapter 17 of the TTP.,1
"There, he elucidates that the HebrewsÕ conviction of being chosen by God, the cornerstone of their national narrative, created a steadfast piety and love for God, their State and towards their fellow citizens.",1
"His discussion reveals how narratives appealing to a certain history can create affective bonds towards institutions, other beings and cultivate political-moral postures that matter in the present.",1
"Accordingly, as Susan James also aptly shows in her book Spinoza on Learning to Live Together, narratives may tell a story of the past, but these stories are central to how present politics is constructed.",1
"SpinozaÕs exploration also reveals the inherent ambiguity and ambivalence of narratives, contributing both to the stability and instability of a political body.",1
"Using the example of the Hebrew State, he illustrates how their national narrative created love and unity while also generating hatred toward outsiders and exclusionary boundaries.",1
"Narratives serve as imaginative devices shaping historical accounts, reflecting power dynamics, and supporting authority.",1
They depict a version or account of history and the world surrounding us Ð but not necessarily the only possible version.,1
"Narratives serve as imaginative devices shaping historical accounts, reflecting power dynamics, and supporting authority.",1
"It is necessary then to distinguish between those narratives that are part and parcel of dominant political agendas, hegemonic narratives, and those counter-narratives that are excluded or ignored by the former.",1
"This distinction acknowledges that narratives are intrinsically contested, and that whenever a story is told other narratives are silenced and untold.",1
This exclusionary practice can have detrimental consequences by displacing individuals and groups within narratives.,1
"Hegemonic narratives, functioning as national self-representations, strengthen civil order, but also suppress depictions that run counter to that worldview.",1
"Thus, just as narratives can help us to find and claim a place in the world, they can also decenter and oppress people and groups, displacing them in space and time.",1
Racial imaginaries are one configuration of this kind of mechanism of displacement inherent to hegemonic narratives.,1
Frantz FanonÕs writings elucidate how narratives can be a political tool for the decentering and marginalization of groups.,1
Narratives can become the locus of suppression and oppression through memories and stories as well as retellings and reconfigurations of the past which impact the present and future.,1
"According to Fanon, the process of racialization Ð as a historical, epistemological and social process by which races are constructed Ð is supported and closely associated with a collective racial imaginary, which is shared by all subjects of a community in the aftermath of colonialism.",1
"With Fanon, we can understand the racial imaginary as the imprint of the colonial system onto the imagination or a specific colonial configuration of the imagination.",1
"Although differing in their conceptualizations of imagination, both Spinoza and Fanon invoke it as a foundational reference or form of knowledge.",1
"They utilize the terms ""imaginary"" and ""imagination"" in contrast to ""clarity"", identifying them as indicators of the fictitious or inadequate.",1
"Crucially, for Spinoza and Fanon, imaginary ideas play a pivotal role in organizing and orienting bodies.",1
"Returning to the potency of narratives, Fanon unveils the extent to which racial imaginaries encompass or exclude narratives Ð akin to the interplay between hegemonic and counter-narratives.",1
"Fanon reveals the enduring impact of coloniality on the racial imaginary, illustrating how a white historical narrative shapes experiences and existence by marginalizing non-white subjects in time and space.",1
"This temporal and spatial displacement, inherent in racial imaginaries, involves undermining prior histories, imposing or eradicating narratives, thereby stripping groups and cultures of their past.",1
"Fanon reveals the enduring impact of coloniality on the racial imaginary, illustrating how a white historical narrative shapes experiences and existence by marginalizing non-white subjects in time and space.",1
"According to Fanon, the dominant racial imaginary, rooted in anti-Black racism and exclusive to white culture and history, facilitates the construction, rationalization, and naturalization of race.",1
This imaginary not only precludes the possibility of a Black narrative but also fractures the frame of reference for non-white subjects.,1
"In Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon describes how the colonized peoplesÕ customs and the agencies to which they refer ""were abolished because they were in contradiction with a new civilization that imposed its own"".",1
"He states that the moment he met the white manÕs gaze, his corporeality was attacked, his frame of reference split and he became aware of his blackness, of his Black body in the middle of a spatial and temporal world that negates his existence.",1
The bodily transformation Fanon experiences is inherently contradictory.,1
"On the one hand, there is no possibility of locating his own body in the spatial and temporal white world surrounding him.",1
"On the other hand, he feels the burden of his body, how it is occupying space and time.",1
"This transformation and fragmentation through the white gaze is an enduring effect, which continues to affect the thinking body by structuring past and present, here and there.",1
"The colonial duration Fanon describes weighs heavily on his body as white narratives of race, a violent future and past are imposed on him.",1
"FanonÕs text manifests how bodies remember and feel histories, how narratives circulate on the surface of bodies, pass through skin and shape an individualÕs affective disposition, that is the way a body can be affected and affect others.",1
"As Fanon describes, the persisting moment of fragmentation prevents the self from connecting to the body and to locate it in the present.",1
"He portrays a feeling of existing in a past that is not his own, but rather part of a white narrative and construction of a racialized world.",1
"Later in Black Skin, White Masks, he writes: ""Too late.",1
"Everything had been predicted, discovered, proved, and exploited.",1
My shaky hands grasped at nothing; the resources had been exhausted.,1
"Too late!"".",1
Several consequences follow from SpinozaÕs and FanonÕs description of the power and use of narratives in politics.,1
Both show the political weight of narratives and that they are used as tools to organize coexistence and societal structures.,1
"Narratives serve as conduits for imaginative knowledge, molding experiences, relations, and interpersonal dynamics.",1
"Fanon and Spinoza, each in their own way, illustrate that narratives are far from innocent, objective, or neutral, but rather are inherently powerful.",1
"The proposed distinction between hegemonic and counter-narratives is useful for accentuating this reality, shedding light on the imaginative origins and political essence of narratives.",1
The concept of counter-narratives is especially important when we consider the link between political change and narratives and ask how far narratives may not only support existing structures but can also be a means for freedom and emancipatory political change.,1
The power of counter-narratives resides in their possibility to navigate bodies differently through space and time and to challenge predominant hegemonic narratives.,1
"For example, we may consider, with reference to Fanon, Black narratives as counter-narratives to hegemonic white narratives in colonial and post-colonial societies.",1
"The power of counter-narratives resides in their possibility to navigate bodies differently through space and time and to challenge predominant hegemonic narratives: narratives cannot only be a means for structural disempowerment and one-sided empowerment but can, as an aesthetic and imaginary tool, help to change relations and structures by illustrating different pasts and worlds otherwise.",1
This is not to say that we may change oppressive and dangerous political systems simply by telling stories.,1
"But narratives, specifically counter-narratives, can help us to understand societal tilts, encourage questions and they can help to reclaim agency.",1
"This suggestion is precarious, particularly within a Spinozist framework, as the longing for political change connected to counter-narratives raises the need for stability: one function of the State.",1
"Nevertheless, every hegemonic order is susceptible to being challenged by counter-hegemonic practices which attempt to disarticulate it.",1
"Moreover, not every challenge presents a destructive intervention or decomposing event but might be part of a regimeÕs strategy to remain and flourish in power.",1
"Indeed, counter-narratives can also be a remedy against the degenerative tendencies of the political regimes Spinoza is concerned about.",1
"Today, the most pressing challenges of political communities are embedded in racial imaginaries and entangled in ongoing coloniality.",1
"Reading Fanon together with Spinoza, who helps us understand the power of narratives and the imagination in politics, might help us find narratives that illustrate how we can live together in mutual empowerment instead of structural disempowerment.",1
Spinoza avoided discussing current events.,1
"When we recognize the nature of those events, his cautious approach makes sense.",1
"SpinozaÕs life was shaped by conflict, hostility, and war.",1
The Netherlands was a fledgling republic at the time of SpinozaÕs birth in Amsterdam in 1632; Dutch independence from the Spanish crown was the bitterly contested outcome of the Dutch-Spanish Eighty Years War (1568-1648) and the wider Thirty Years War (1618-1648).,1
"At the other end of his life, Spinoza was thirty-nine years old when in May of 1672 the Dutch Republic was beset by hostile powers on land (principally, France) and sea (the United Kingdom).",1
"1672 became the ""Rampjaar"" or ""disaster year"".",1
"The De Witt brothers, champions of the Dutch States Party (liberal Dutch republicans opposed to the dynastic politics of the Princes of Orange), were massacred by a vengeful mob in streets not far from SpinozaÕs home; one of SpinozaÕs first biographers anecdotally recounts how Spinoza had to be physically restrained by his landlord from confronting the crowd with a placard reading: ""Ultimi barbarorum"" Ð ""last of the barbarians"").",1
"Under De Witt governance, Dutch trade and science leaped ahead; the sudden and violent collapse of this First Stadtholderless Period (1650-1672) marked the end of a brief interlude in what was otherwise a torrential period of armed conflict and destruction.",1
"After 1672, SpinozaÕs Holland reverted to princely power buttressed by religious orthodoxy; presciently, Spinoza had theorized the dangers of such a theological-political configuration in his 1670 masterwork, the Theologico-Political Treatise.",1
What little hope there was for an enlightened and sage life was threatened on all sides.,1
"While Spinoza only once evokes the warfare that plagued his native Holland (and only in his private correspondence), there are ample explicit discussions of conflict, hostility, and war in his published works.",1
"Nonetheless, these elements of SpinozaÕs political philosophy have not received sufficient attention.",1
"Partly this may be because we have become accustomed to think of SpinozaÕs political leanings as radically progressive, if not utopian.",1
"However, thinking about SpinozaÕs approach to the problem of war and the StateÕs prerogative to wage war is important.",1
"For one thing, if we want to see how Spinoza takes his political philosophy to the international level, we need to understand what he makes of war.",1
"In fact, the problem of war also concerns SpinozaÕs general conception of the State.",1
"If we want to see how Spinoza takes his political philosophy to the international level, we need to understand what he makes of war.",1
"Spinoza thinks that the State, the sovereign political unit, is an instrument for collective, mutually beneficial action and peaceful coexistence.",1
"Likewise, reason commands us as individuals to pursue peace and forge relations of friendship; in part, reason is simply recognizing and promoting the conditions for a life where reason itself can take root and we can flourish under our best aspect.",1
"In this way, States are not contingent productions of human history.",1
Their genesis is a result of the way we spontaneously and necessarily come together to form social bonds.,1
Early modern philosophers introduced the thought experiment of the social contract to account for the way that individuals come together to form mutually beneficial bonds despite the sacrifice of freedoms this involves.,1
"While in the earlier Theologico-Political Treatise Spinoza makes use of the trope, in SpinozaÕs final political work, the Political Treatise (1677), Spinoza goes without talk of the social contract altogether.",1
"While reason recognizes the value of the State, and while it posits that the legislative power is binding in its demands, the State comes into being as a product of the free play of social passions, and not because of some non-coercive, consensual contract among rational individuals.",1
"Nonetheless, State competition and conflict are, Spinoza sees, necessary features of international relations.",1
"More fundamentally still, the war powers of the State belong to the essential nature of the State.",1
The political unit is only sovereign to the extent that it has such powers.,1
This looks like a catch-22: the State is both a key instrument in the construction of peace and an impediment to achieving lasting peace.,1
Why should Spinoza think that the war powers of the State belong to its essential nature?,1
SpinozaÕs thinking here consists in an application of his theory of natural right.,1
"On SpinozaÕs theory of natural right, power and right are coextensive, and thus, by nature, all things have as much right as they have power.",1
The StateÕs power is a case in point.,1
"Whatever the State has the power to do, it has the right to do, including to wage war; indeed, for it to be a sovereign power means that it has retained that power and right to wage war as it sees fit.",1
This is not to say that Spinoza does not recognize the dangers of a warmongering polity.,1
"On the contrary: while all States aspire to defend themselves against hostile belligerent powers, Spinoza frequently observes with a touch of irony how many States sow their own ruin in looking to protect themselves from external threats by means of militarization.",1
"The latter worry animates numerous passages of SpinozaÕs political works, where the focus is indeed often less on the perils of warfare as such and more on how poor oversight of the StateÕs war powers can lead to the StateÕs undoing.",1
"Spinoza shows that this is particularly the case with monarchies, as their power for war is prone to becoming a socially and politically destabilizing force and contributing to their descent into tyranny.",1
"Notwithstanding SpinozaÕs cautionary tales, the fact remains that, in SpinozaÕs theory, war powers constitute a hallmark expression of State power.",1
"In Chapter 3, section 13 of the Political Treatise, Spinoza adduces a further consideration here in support of his view, namely that since States (or ""commonwealths"") are by nature enemies, a sovereign power always has ""the rights of war"": By nature two commonwealths are enemies.",1
For in the state of nature men are enemies.,1
So those who retain the right of nature outside a commonwealth remain enemies.,1
"So if one commonwealth wants to make war on another, and will stop at nothing to bring it under its control, it has the right to try this.",1
To wage war itÕs enough for it to have the will to wage war.,1
But it canÕt settle anything about peace unless the other commonwealth voluntarily acquiesces.,1
"From this it follows that the rights of war belong to each commonwealth, whereas the rights of peace belong, not to one commonwealth, but to at least two commonwealths, which for that reason are called allies.",1
"International relations are said to be analogous to the relations between human individuals in the state of nature, and thus characterized in terms of hostility.",1
"However, Spinoza thinks that human individuals in the pre-political state of nature can (and, in fact, must) assemble and unite their forces to bring each other mutual aid and secure their peace and well-being.",1
It is this very process of unification that generates the political State in the first place.,1
"Why then wouldnÕt States assemble into peaceful unities with one another like human individuals, but instead retain their right of war?",1
"This might seem unprincipled, but the elements of an answer are at hand.",1
"Human individuals are susceptible to limitations on power that require them to bind forces, while States are not, and thus States can maintain a level of autonomy which human individuals cannot.",1
"This bifurcation gives rise to the twist in the humanÐState analogy argument above: States are hostile to one another like human individuals in the pre-political state of nature, yet human individuals can successfully emerge out of the pre-political state of nature while States paradoxically cannot.",1
"Human individuals are susceptible to limitations on power that require them to bind forces, while States are not, and thus States can maintain a level of autonomy which human individuals cannot.",1
The twists and bifurcations in SpinozaÕs reasoning testify to the ways that SpinozaÕs political philosophy is burdened by war.,1
Spinoza wants to have it both ways.,1
"He wants to secure a realism about war without abandoning his view that there is an ultimate aspirational good, human flourishing, and that we should look to this summum bonum to rationally judge the value of the State and political life.",1
"Neither strand of his thought fully takes the upper hand, but it is the former strand, I suspect, that might surprise us today.",1
"SpinozaÕs realism further sustains the civic republican conception of martial virtue in his political thought, where the model States designed in the Political Treatise are designed in part with an eye to success at war.",1
"They will fight well, they will fight hard, and their victory will stand for their virtue; indeed, if all States must fight, then the best States should fight the best.",1
"When it comes to war, Spinoza has not had the same level of impact as other early modern thinkers, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Kant.",1
Yet SpinozaÕs views deserve revisiting.,1
"Far from having resolved the underlying puzzles of those views here, at least I think it might be clear that SpinozaÕs recognition of the unpleasant realities of war should concern us in view of our own current events.",1
Germany and the United States are deeply linked together: Our joint history has led us through both bright and dark chapters and resulted in the deep friendship we enjoy today.,1
"That friendship is based on our shared commitment to personal freedom and dignity, which only a vibrant democracy under the rule of law can guarantee.",1
Our countries share a joint responsibility to protect and preserve our way of life.,1
It is in this spirit that we are working hard to ensure that international law and norms are respected around the globe Ð which remains a prerequisite for stability and prosperity.,1
Our countries are committed to collective defense within the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) because we want to preserve the security of the Euro-Atlantic area as a whole.,1
"We cooperate closely in the fight against terror, including in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, because we must protect our citizens and because we will not sacrifice our way of life to the enemies of freedom.",1
"Our deep respect for human dignity compels us to provide humanitarian relief and aid for millions of refugees worldwide, because we know it is our treatment of those most vulnerable that determines the true strength of our values.",1
And U.S.-German partnership was essential to achieving a global agreement in Paris that offers the world a framework for protecting our planet.,1
"These values of democracy, justice and freedom form the foundation of our successful economies.",1
Both Germans and Americans know that these principles are the basis for creativity and innovation which drive our economic development.,1
"And both our countries embrace the idea that the socially responsible market economy, also includes a commitment to social security, advancement opportunities, quality education for all, and an advanced and efficient infrastructure.",1
"The paths that we choose in pursuit of these goals, like how we organize our social security system or our universities, may vary, but the underlying bedrock of our shared values is strong.",1
"On this firm basis of shared values, German-American economic relations are flourishing.",1
"Europe and the United States form the largest economic zone in the world, accounting for one third of global trade and almost half of the global gross domestic product.",1
Strong German-American economic relations form an unshakeable core of this zone.,1
"Since 2015, the United States has become GermanyÕs most important trading partner with a trade volume of 173 billion euros, and conversely, Germany has become a cornerstone of U.S.",1
economic relations with the European Union.,1
"Indeed, the significance of transatlantic trade is even more impressive when we look at trade between the United States and whole of the EU: the trading volume in 2015 amounted to 620 billion euros, the largest between any two partners worldwide.",1
Behind these impressive figures are millions of companies and employees who produce these traded goods and services and whose jobs depend on them.,1
"Of course, German-American relations go far beyond trade.",1
"Our companies invest to a great extent in each otherÕs country; they cooperate with each other in projects, joint ventures, and in investments.",1
"Germans make pilgrimages to Silicon Valley, where people practice and think about the future of the digital economy more than anywhere else.",1
"Americans thrive in GermanyÕs many world-class manufacturing and engineering companies, small and large.",1
Americans and Germans learn from each otherÕs labor systems and study how each benefits their citizens: Americans study GermanyÕs remarkable labor apprenticeship system and Germans learn from how American companies benefit from the United StatesÕ spectacular diversity.,1
The basis of such close economic relations is often the personal contact between our citizens.,1
"Our people flow across the Atlantic as students, scientists, artists, employees and tourists.",1
"Our two-way trade and investment opens new opportunities for synergies, new products, and innovations in technology.",1
"At the end of 2014, bilateral investments between Germany and the U.S.",1
"totaled $339 billion, creating high-paying jobs in both our countries.",1
Simply put: we are stronger when we work together.,1
"At a time when the global economy is evolving more quickly than at any point in human history, and the scope of global challenges has never had higher stakes, such cooperation is now more urgent than ever.",1
"Germany and the United States are spearheading this effort, including through our work in the G-20, the Presidency of which Germany will assume this December.",1
"Together in the G-20 we are working to both strengthen global growth and make it more inclusive, while also addressing pressing broad global challenges like climate change, migration, and global health security, and specific challenges like addressing excess capacity in steel and other industries.",1
We also see great potential for successful cooperation in future-oriented areas such as the digitalization of the workplace.,1
Our shared conviction about the power of trade and investment to lift living standards prompted us to pursue the important project of establishing a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP).,1
"There is no question that both German and American employers, workers, consumers, and farmers would profit from T-TIP.",1
"Negotiations started three years ago and, considering the complexity of these issues, have made solid progress.",1
"An agreement that knits our economies closer together, based on rules that reflect our shared values, would help us grow and remain globally competitive for decades to come.",1
"Today, many U.S.",1
and European companies and employees already benefit from transatlantic trade and investments.,1
Global markets and production chains are increasingly intertwined.,1
We realize that decisions in one country have tangible effects in others.,1
"To meet all these challenges, we need rules that are currently being negotiated in the framework of T-TIP.",1
"Today we find ourselves at a crossroadsÑthe future is upon us, and we will never return to a pre-globalization economy.",1
Germans and Americans we must seize the opportunity to shape globalization based on our values and our ideas.,1
"We owe it to our industries and our peoplesÑindeed, to the global communityÑto broaden and deepen our cooperation.",1
"If I had to sum up the election of 2016 in one clause, I would say it has been a sociological revolution, a moral warning and a political summons.",1
"Sociologically, this campaign has been an education in how societies come apart.",1
"The Trump campaign has been like a flash flood that sweeps away the topsoil and both reveals and widens the chasms, crevices and cracks below.",1
We are a far more divided society than we realized.,1
The educated and less educated increasingly see the world and vote in different ways.,1
"So do men and women, blacks and whites, natives and immigrants, young and old, urban and rural.",1
"We like to think of democracy as a battle of ideas and a process of individual deliberation, but this year demography has been destiny.",1
The campaigns have pushed us back into our tribal bunkers.,1
"Americans now seem more clannish, and more incomprehensible to one another.",1
This year a legitimate social uprising has been twisted to serve destructive means.,1
"Over the past 50 years, most of us have benefited from feminism, the civil rights movement, mass immigration, the information age and the sexual revolution.",1
"But as Charles Murray points out, one class has been buffeted by each of these trends: white workers.",1
"The white working class once sat comfortably at the core of the American idea, but now its members have seen their skills devalued, their neighborhoods transformed, their masculinity delegitimized, their family structures decimated, their dignity erased and their basic decency questioned.",1
"Marginalized, they commonly feel invisible, alienated and culturally pessimistic.",1
This year the workers overthrew their corporate masters and grabbed control of the Republican Party.,1
"That would be progress and even inspiring, but Ñ maybe because of the candidate who is leading it Ñ the working-class revolt has been laced with bigotry, anti-Semitism, class hatred, misogyny and authoritarianism that has further rent the American fabric.",1
"Our partisan divides now menacingly overlap with our racial and class divides, threatening to form a trinity of discord with horrendous consequences.",1
The moral health of the polity is in even scarier shape.,1
"Any decent society rests on codes of etiquette and a shared moral ecology to make cooperation possible, to prevent economic and political life from descending into a savage war of all against all.",1
But this year Donald Trump has decimated the codes of basic decency without paying a price.,1
"With his constant, flagrant and unapologetic lying, he has shredded the standards of intellectual virtue Ñ the normal respect for facts and truth that makes conversation possible.",1
"With his penchant for cruelty, bigotry, narcissism, selfishness and even his primitive primate dominance displays, he has shredded the accepted understandings of personal morality that prevent the strong from preying on the weak.",1
"Most disturbing, all of this has been greeted with moral numbness.",1
The truest thing Trump said all year is that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes.,1
"We learned this year that millions of Americans are incapable of being morally offended, or of putting virtue above partisanship.",1
And that brings us to the summons.,1
The events of 2016 represent a watershed and a call to do politics differently.,1
"Personally IÕve always disdained talk of a third party, mostly because the structural barriers against such parties are so high, no matter how scintillatingly attractive they seem in theory.",1
But itÕs becoming clear that the need for a third party outweighs even the very real barriers.,1
"The Republican Party will probably remain the white working-class party, favoring closed trade, closed borders and American withdrawal abroad.",1
"The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is increasingly dominated by its left/Sanders wing, which offers its own populism of the left.",1
There has to be a party for those who are now homeless.,1
There has to be a party as confidently opposed to populism as populists are in favor of it.,1
"There has to be a compassionate globalist party, one that embraces free trade while looking after those who suffer from trade; that embraces continued skilled immigration while listening to those hurt by immigration; that embraces widening ethnic diversity while understanding that diversity can weaken social trust.",1
There has to be a patriotic party that understands that the world benefits when America serves as the leading and energetic superpower.,1
There has to be a party that unapologetically emphasizes public character formation.,1
ItÕs not clear that our political culture is producing individuals capable of exercising freedom wisely.,1
"But citizenship is a skill that can be nurtured Ñ by a party that insists on basic standards of decency in its candidates; that practices politics in humble, honest ways; that strengthens trust and institutions by playing by the rules, by confirming appointees and the like.",1
The problems go deeper than the jobless rate and the threat of ISIS.,1
The underlying social and moral foundations of the nation have been weakened.,1
Today a rancid chapter ends.,1
Tomorrow letÕs start with fresh ground and a new party.,1
"As the 114th Congress comes to an end, it is worth looking back on my first term in Congress and highlight the important accomplishments and the change that Americans should expect before the 115th Congress convenes next year.",1
"While there has been much disagreement between Republicans and Democrats in the nation's capital, progress on issues that earned bipartisan support should not be overlooked.",1
"During the 114th Congress, Medicare was put on stronger footing by the ""Doc Fix."" This improvement was signed into law to permanently repeal the practice of allowing automatic cuts to doctors' payments under Medicare, which threatened seniors' access to their doctors.",1
"For many years, Congress would temporarily delay these cuts on an annual basis, and now there is a long-term bipartisan agreement.",1
"Congress just recently passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law by President Obama.",1
"Not only did the legislation streamline development and federal approval of life-saving drugs, but it included improvements for our nation's mental health care system.",1
"The bill also included state grants to fight the opioid epidemic that is sweeping the nation, including communities in Central Washington.",1
"For Washingtonians in particular, one important accomplishment of the 114th Congress was to make the federal tax deduction for state and local sales tax permanent.",1
"In 2012, Washington families saved $602 from this deduction, and making this provision permanent allows them to plan ahead.",1
These are a few examples of recent accomplishments during a period of divided government.,1
"In 2017, unified Republican control of the federal government will result in a dramatic shift from the Obama years.",1
One of the most important changes is a return to the system laid out in Article I of the Constitution.,1
Article I delegates all legislative authority to Congress.,1
"During the past two years, hard-fought legislative priorities would be passed by Congress only to be vetoed by President Obama.",1
"President Obama's ""pen and phone"" strategyÑmeant to maximize his power through executive actions and federal regulations while bypassing Congress on a host of issuesÑoverstepped the constitutional powers of the presidency.",1
"Congress was forced to hold the line on overreaching executive actions and agency regulations, and in many cases the federal courts have found that the administration exceeded its authority.",1
"For the health of our republic, the executive branch must stay within its constitutional limits regardless of who occupies the White House.",1
"There have been high-profile bipartisan legislative accomplishments in the past two years, but the nation's government was largely divided between an overreaching executive and a resistant Congress.",1
"In the final weeks of the Obama administration, few actions have been as shocking as the decision to abandon our best ally in the Middle East, Israel.",1
"Israel not only shares our democratic values, but it is also a key U.S. ally in anti-terrorism efforts.",1
The U.S. has traditionally exercised its veto power it has on the United Nations Security Council to prevent one-sided anti-Israel measures from being approved.,1
"The shameful abstention by the Obama administration in December's Security Council vote on Resolution 2334, which was blatantly anti-Israel, stabbed our friend in the back.",1
"The UN resolution was so extreme that it declared the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Judaism's holiest site, as ""occupied territory,"" denying Israel's ancient connection to the last remnants of the Second Jewish Temple.",1
"The UN resolution undermines the peace process because any Israeli-Palestinian solution must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties, not imposed by anti-Israel representatives at the UN.",1
The UN resolution hardens both sides rather than encouraging the goal of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace.,1
"In 2015, I had the opportunity to visit Israel, the only democracy in the region, and I saw firsthand the reality of the dire security situation facing Israelis.",1
"Many Americans have no idea how precarious the existence of Israel is, with routine acts of terrorism and regional enemies such as Iran vowing to wipe the Jewish state off the map.",1
"On Thursday, January 5th, I voted in favor of a Congressional resolution to disapprove of President Obama's decision to abandon Israel at the UN.",1
The bipartisan vote of 342-80 in the House united Republicans and Democrats to send a strong message to condemn the administration's decision.,1
My hope is that the damage done to the American-Israeli alliance will be repaired under the incoming administration.,1
"At a time of increasing violence and turmoil in the Middle East, America needs to stand by its friends.",1
It is my commitment to continue to stand with Israel.,1
"Last year, I joined my colleagues on the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to study the rise of China and its influence on the United States.",1
"We dug deeper into the exponential purchase of American farmland, exposed censorship on platforms such as TikTok, and discovered fraudulent medical labs funded by the CCP, constant intellectual property theft, and cyber espionage missions targeting our critical infrastructure.",1
The latest development in this saga is the concern of misinformation campaigns targeting our elections.,1
"Over the past year, the Select Committee on the CCP has heard from experts across numerous fields about emerging trends on digital media.",1
Their testimony reinforces concerns over the advanced technologies being used in sophisticated misinformation campaigns intended to target social media users.,1
"From AI to deep fakes, the rise in social media and algorithmic warfare is troubling to say the least.",1
"Our adversaries are getting more sophisticated, and as technology advances, it is critical our election integrity policies stay one step ahead.",1
"The cyber domain is an evolving arena in international conflict, with the CCP emerging as a prominent playerÑboth on offense and defense.",1
"Since the early 2000s, the CCP has been systematically involved in cyber espionage campaigns against the United States, targeting government agencies, defense contractors, technology firms, and our critical infrastructure systems.",1
"These operations are part of a broader strategy to elevate the CCPÕs economic and military position on a global stage, and because our democracy relies on safe and fair elections, and it is crucial we take every step necessary to maintain and restore voter confidence and participation, which is one of the reasons why the Select Committee on the CCPÕs work is so important.",1
"Last month, I questioned General Paul Nakasone, Commander of the United States Cyber Command and NSA, Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Christopher Wray, Director of the FBI, in a Select Committee Hearing on the CCPÕs cyber threat.",1
"They spoke about how our Cyber Command, CISA, FBI, and private sector capabilities are the best in the world, and we have numerous safeguards in place to ensure free and fair elections.",1
"There are 8,800 separate jurisdictions at the state and local level that conduct election processes, which gives a flexible and decentralized system that can adapt to our complex electoral environment, and it was designed this way for a reason.",1
"But as the CCP continues to innovate, we cannot be backed into a corner with respect to new and emerging capabilities that pose a direct threat to national security and election security.",1
"As Director Wray stated, Ò[TikTok's] parent company is effectively beholden to the Chinese governmentÉ[which] gives them the ability, should they so choose, to control the software on millions of devices, which means the opportunity to technically compromise millions of devices.""",1
"As a member of the Select Committee on the CCP as well as an American voter, I remain committed to protecting our elections and empowering citizens to exercise their rights.",1
"I have great faith in our democratic process and the will of the American people at the ballot box, but the emerging threat of technological misinformation campaigns consistently used by our adversaries seeks to interfere with that will.",1
"As a third-generation farmer from Sunnyside, I understand the crucial role agriculture plays in our region.",1
"From tree fruits and hops to apples, potatoes, and wine grapes, Central Washington farmers produce over 300 different products and contribute over $9 billion in agriculture production to our economy.",1
"But without prioritizing our next generation of farmers, this level of impact will soon become impossible to replicate.",1
"The average age of farmers in the United States is 57 and a half years old, with only 9% under the age of 35.",1
"Children growing up on family farms today often want to leave to seek out other professions, and there is a great degree of difficultyÑboth in interest and due to barriers to entryÑin getting youngers Americans without an agricultural background to become agricultural producers.",1
Our nationÕs future ability to feed our population and support international trade largely depends on our youth being interested and engaged in farming and agricultural sciences.,1
"This week is National FFA Week, and there is no better time to recognize the incredible work this program does.",1
"As a former member of the FFA, I know firsthand how vital this program is for youth not only in Central Washington, but across the country.",1
"FFA helps to advance a studentÕs knowledge of agriculture, and teaches them how to cultivate community relationships, take on leadership opportunities, and become further educated on the changing world around us.",1
"While learning all about agriculture, FFA also prioritizes science, math, and other skills that will help members work on the current and future problems our rural communities face.",1
"As a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, this is a topic I discuss with my colleagues on a regular basis.",1
"In order for our family farms to survive, we not only need the younger generations to join the agricultural workforceÑwe also need to keep farms in the family.",1
"Today, we see a major threat to this: the death tax.",1
"In January, I co-sponsored the re-introduction of the Death Tax Repeal Act to protect the operations of family farms and ranches from the unfair and burdensome federal estate tax, also known as the death tax.",1
Family farms should not be forced to close or sell out in order to pay an unfair tax.,1
Part of the American Dream is about sustainability; working hard so you can pass the fruits of your labor on to your family.,1
Repealing this tax once and for all is the best way for our small business owners to protect that sustainability and pass their farms onto the next generation.,1
Every step we can take to make entry to agriculture easier and more appealing for younger Americans means more of them will go into farming in the future.,1
"The work the FFA does to build interest in agriculture in our next generation is critical, so this National FFA Week, letÕs all look to our future farmers and thank them for the work they do to pave the way for the next generation.",1
The United States produces the cleanest and safest energy in the world from traditional resources like oil and natural gas as well as from emerging resources and innovative technologies.,1
"This is something we should be celebrating, but instead, President Biden has waged an unprecedented war on American energy producers since taking office, which has caused our energy prices to skyrocket in order to appease the extreme climate lobby.",1
"On January 26, 2024, President Biden announced he will pause all pending approvals of liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals under the guise of climate change.",1
"However, this decision does nothing but create uncertainty and discourages investments that would otherwise create jobs and expand our supply of domestic natural gas.",1
"Worst of all, it goes against its intended goal.",1
"By shutting down our LNG exports, we are giving way to Russia to produce more natural gas in a much less environmentally friendly way.",1
"Clean natural gas is a significant reason why the U.S has been able to reduce its emissions more than any other nation, and the Department of Energy (DOE) has already commissioned five studies to examine the effects of LNG exports in the U.S.",1
"Their findings have overwhelmingly shown the environmental benefits, proving that our exports are 41% cleaner than the alternativeÑRussian natural gas delivered to Europe.",1
"The United States is positioned to support our allies in Europe who are looking to end their reliance on Russian natural gas, but the Biden Administration seems determined to give Vladimir Putin the gift of our passiveness.",1
The decision to deny future LNG export permits is yet another assault on American energy production that jeopardizes our national security and global energy markets.,1
The indefinite ban has already disrupted the global energy markets and has sent our allies a signal that the United States is no longer a dependable energy trading partner.,1
Is this the message the Biden Administration wants to send to the international community in times of such uncertainty?,1
"This lack of forward thinking is unacceptable, which is why I strongly support H.R. 7176, the Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act.",1
"The bill would effectively lift all restrictions on the import and export of natural gas, with strong protections to prohibit trade with a person or foreign country under sanction or listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.",1
It is imperative that we support the safe and responsible development of our own domestic energy portfolio to protect our national security interests and lower energy costs for all Americans.,1
"Simply put, domestic natural gas prices are lower and more stable when we have free trade and open markets, and this decision to ban exports does nothing but discourage the creation of jobs and drive those prices up.",1
"If we were to prioritize an all-of-the-above approach to American energy, we would increase LNG exports, adding as much as $73 billion to our economy and creating upwards of 453,000 jobs for Americans by the year 2040.",1
"Whether itÕs cancelling the Keystone XL Pipeline, halting future LNG export terminal permits, or revoking leases for oil, gas, and mining across the West, it is clear that President BidenÕs policies have given Russia and OPEC a greater advantage than domestic producers.",1
"Central Washingtonians deserve affordable and reliable energy, and I encourage the Biden Administration to listen to those of us whose districts lead the country in clean, reliable energy production.",1
"As a third-generation farmer, I understand how important agriculture is for families, jobs, and trade in Central Washington.",1
"Our districtÕs farmers and producers grow the highest quality hay, wheat and more than 300 specialty crops, making agriculture a vital part of our economy.",1
"But foreign adversaries are purchasing U.S. farmland at an alarming rate, posing a threat to Central WashingtonÕs most crucial industry, and the federal government is struggling to keep up.",1
"Last week the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report revealing that the U.S Department of AgricultureÕs (USDA) system of tracking foreign ownership of our agricultural land is wildly inaccurate, posing a threat to our national security interests.",1
"According to the USDAÕs own estimates, foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land grew to approximately 40 million acres in 2021Ña staggering number compared to previous years.",1
"In Washington state alone, roughly 1,717,990 acres of farmland is owned by foreign entities.",1
"This report confirms one of our worst fears: that not only is the USDA unable to answer the question of who owns what land and where, but that there is no plan by the department to internally reverse this dangerous flaw that affects our supply chain and economy.",1
"With the USDA only updating their land tracking database once per year, it is impossible for their data to be relevant and up to date.",1
We also have evidence that their reporting is prone to be incorrect.,1
"In 2023, the Chinese Communist PartyÕs (CCP) largest land holding was counted twice/ This forces the questionÑwhat other mistakes could be hiding in their data?",1
"As your representative in Congress, I have been working to prevent our adversaries from purchasing domestic farmland.",1
"In my role on the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the CCP, I introduced legislation to specifically prevent foreign adversaries from purchasing land near our national security sites.",1
"As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I passed an amendment to the Agricultural and Rural Development Appropriations bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to prohibit the CCP, Russia, North Korea, and Iran from purchasing our agricultural land.",1
"Last year, I introduced the Prohibition of Agricultural Land for the PeopleÕs Republic of China Act to prohibit the purchase of public or private agricultural land in the United States by foreign nationals associated with the Government of the PeopleÕs Republic of China.",1
"While legislation is a great first step, I will, in my capacity as a member of the Select Committee on the CCP, Chairman of the Western Caucus, and as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, be working to introduce further measures aimed at fixing USDAÕs internal reporting and data management to identify to Congress, and the American people, exactly who is investing in the over 40 million acres of U.S. farmland reported to have ties to foreign actors.",1
"When I speak with farmers and landowners throughout Central Washington they express deep concern about this encroachment on our land from foreign adversaries, and resolving this systematic issue within USDA is the next step in ensuring it is protected.",1
"Ten or so years ago, whenever I could find the time, I began to immerse myself in the history of American chattel slavery and its legacy.",1
"In 2014, while I was occupying the office of the chair of the Yale Philosophy Department in Connecticut Hall, I was brought face to face with an inscription above the door: ÒEli Whitney 1792 Occupied this Room.Ó I happened then to be reading Edward BaptistÕs The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism, a study of cotton slavery in the United States.",1
"Thinking about WhitneyÕs role in cotton production prompted me to write an op-ed piece in the Yale Daily News about YaleÕs, and ultimately my own, complicity with slavery and its legacy.",1
"Cotton and textile production would have been impossible without WhitneyÕs invention of the cotton gin, which pulled cotton fibers from the seed and enabled the mechanization and ÒrationalizationÓ of cotton slavery and textile manufacturing well beyond the relatively feudal forms that tobacco slavery and production took.",1
"This made possible massive profits and the SouthÕs, indeed the U.S.Õs, integration into an increasingly capitalist global economy.",1
Whereas in 1791 the U.S.,1
"produced only one percent of the worldÕs cotton, by 1860 U.S.",1
cotton production had soared to 67 percent of a vastly larger world total.,1
"In 1830, cotton represented fully 61 percent of our national exports.",1
"Having also recently read Thomas PikettyÕs Capital in the Twenty-First Century, I knew that it was not until the beginning of the industrial revolution in England in the 1790s that Western economies escaped the ÒMalthusian trapÓ and began accumulating national wealth, leading ultimately to the standards of living we enjoy in the developed world today.",1
Only when the knitting machines in ManchesterÕs textile mills could hum with cotton provided almost entirely by the American enslaved could wealth accumulation take off and make possible the investments on which even our current prosperity depends.,1
"My point in the Yale Daily News was that although Eli Whitney, a Yale undergraduate from Massachusetts, was not directly involved in the slave trade, he was a critical contributor who massively profited from it.",1
"In this way, I argued, he was not unlike many of my readers and myself.",1
The purchase of enslaved labor was financed by bonds (like todayÕs securitized mortgages) that were sold throughout the North and also globally.,1
"A little over two years ago, I began to think about offering an undergraduate seminar on ÒThe Morality of Reparations,Ó which I gave first in Fall 2020 and again in Spring 2022.",1
"I approached the course with trepidation, owing partly to my position of white male privilege, but also due to my relative ignorance of relevant literatures, including Black activist literature.",1
I am extremely indebted to Will Darwall for discussion of what to include and to all of the students in the two seminars for their forbearance and open-minded and open-hearted engagement.,1
"Thinking through these issues with my students has been one of the most challenging, bracing, and ultimately satisfying experiences of my life.",1
Although Olf__mi O.,1
"Tw rightly emphasizes that since racialization and the slave trade were global phenomena, reparations must ultimately also be global, my main focus in the two seminars was on the United States.",1
"What follows are some of the results of my studentsÕ and my attempts to think through the morality of reparations, conceived broadly to include measures of many different kinds at many levels, institutional and personal.",1
"We now know an enormous amount, in granular detail, about the history and contours of American slavery and its aftermath, including: the convict leasing program, which tied formerly enslaved people to the plantation and other sites of exploitation ÒlegallyÓ; the terror of the Klan and intimidation of Black people at the end of Radical Reconstruction; Jim Crow, housing and school segregation; mass incarceration, and so on.",1
"Formerly enslaved Americans and their descendants, fleeing white terror and seeking a better life in the North, undertook a ÒGreat MigrationÓ only to find themselves confined to Northern urban ghettos where they faced increasing challenges brought on by the NorthÕs own style of segregation, urban decay, crumbling schools, massive unemployment, drugs, and violence.",1
"If white Americans do not know this sorry history, it is because it is something they cannot or will not bear to think about.",1
"The Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, was ratified in 1865.",1
"Under the cover of Section 2, the Congress then passed the Civil Rights Act in 1866, an important step in the political empowerment of the formerly enslaved during Radical Reconstruction.",1
"The Act gave Black citizens an assortment of political and other basic rights, notably, the right not to be discriminated against in housing.",1
"This was later overturned, however, paving the way for de jure housing discrimination as a matter of local, state, and federal law and policy right up until the Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968.",1
"For most Americans today, housing is the major component of their wealth.",1
Median Black family income is about 60 percent of that for whites in the U.S.,1
That is of course a shocking figure.,1
But it is nothing like the difference between white and Black average wealth.,1
"Median white household wealth is about $134,000, whereas median Black household wealth is roughly $11,000.",1
This means that median Black household wealth is only about 8% of median white household wealth.,1
And that means that housing segregation has brought wealth segregation in its train.,1
"Moreover, if, as Richard Rothstein shows in The Color of Law, housing segregation is not just de facto but de jure, then wealth segregation has been effectively de jure as well.",1
"It is clear that the enormous wealth disparities between Black and white American citizens are the continuing legacy of slavery, amplified by continuing oppression pursued through putatively legitimate institutions at every governmental level together with interlocking social and cultural institutions, including the very institutions in which academic philosophy is practiced.",1
What is an adequate response to this manifest injustice?,1
"We may distinguish between reparations, conceived broadly to include any attempt to address past and continuing injustice, on the one hand, and repair, on the other, which seeks to heal emotional wounds the injustice has caused.",1
"We may distinguish between reparations, conceived broadly to include any attempt to address past and continuing injustice, on the one hand, and repair, on the other, which seeks to heal emotional wounds the injustice has caused.",1
"I address the latter issue in a forthcoming book, The Heart and Its Attitudes.",1
"What measures might be taken, I there ask, to heal broken hearts and spirits, most obviously, of Black Americans, but also of whites, whose souls have been misshapen by white supremacy?",1
"Here, however, I focus on the former: reparations for injustice and the abolition of white supremacy.",1
"Clearly, very significant measures are called for at every level.",1
"A minimal first step nationally would be for Congress to pass HR 40, originally introduced by John Conyers into the House of Representatives in 2017.",1
"HR 40 seeks Òto address the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the 13 American colonies between 1619 and 1865 and to establish a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery, its subsequent de jure and de facto racial and economic discrimination against African-Americans, and the impact of these forces on living African-Americans, to make recommendations to the Congress on appropriate remedies, and for other purposes.Ó Whatever substantive steps justice requires nationally, these should result, and be seen to result, from just democratic procedures.",1
So passing HR 40 is a necessary first step.,1
"Concerning what justice requires substantively, there are two main schools of thought.",1
"These are not mutually exclusive, but they do approach the fundamental issues in different ways.",1
"One is to focus on injuries to individuals: those who were initially forced to leave their homelands in Africa, to die in or endure unspeakably harsh conditions during the Middle Passage, and those then forced into slavery in the American Colonies and, later the United States, as well as those who were born into slavery on our shores.",1
"But it also includes, at the very least, those who have descended from the enslaved: ÒAmerican Descendants of Slavery,Ó as the ADOS Foundation calls them.",1
It arguably also includes many more Black Americans who have no ancestral ties to American chattel slavery.,1
"These individuals descend from citizens who were subjected to later forms of discrimination and violence such as lynching and police violence, Jim Crow, and various forms of segregation and discrimination, and many descendants have been subjected to these themselves.",1
"This individualist approach follows the model of the law of torts; it seeks to provide just compensation for those who have been unjustly injured Ð to make them whole in the sense of being no worse off, all things considered.",1
"A common challenge when it comes to injuries suffered by the enslaved, as well as by later individuals no longer alive, is that there is no way that individuals who are dead can be compensated now.",1
"In reply, Bernard Boxill has forcefully advanced an Òinheritance argumentÓ that debts that were incurred by the United States, and therefore the American people, earlier, can be inherited and that these can be justly paid to those who would have inherited the compensation had it been paid earlier.",1
"Individualist approaches are, however, insufficient in themselves, since they ignore structural or systemic racism.",1
"Even if every individual with a valid claim were to be provided reparations that justly compensate their injuries from white supremacy, it would do nothing to address systemic racism.",1
"It could, of course, take into account injuries that systemic racism has caused to individuals, but it might not touch the structural factors themselves and so would continue to make Black citizens vulnerable to white supremacy.",1
A just response to the legacy of American slavery would therefore have to speak to these systemic factors.,1
Such a structural approach can fairly be termed abolitionist.,1
"Just as the original abolitionists sought to end slavery as a sociopolitical system, present day abolitionism would seek to abolish ongoing white supremacy as a system of racist oppression.",1
The situation is analogous to the related but more familiar Constitutional process involving school desegregation in the 1950s through the early 1970s.,1
"In Brown in 1954, the Court found that laws mandating school segregation were unconstitutional because they violated the Fourteenth AmendmentÕs Equal Protection Clause.",1
"It was only in later cases, however, that the Court came to realize that school desegregation could not be accomplished just by declaring de jure segregation unconstitutional.",1
"In a run of cases, prominently including Green (1968) and Swann (1971) Ð the famous bussing decision Ð the Court continued to seek and fashion remedies that, in the words of Green, would remove school segregation Òroot and branch.Ó Just as further affirmative steps were (and still remain) necessary to uproot school segregation, so also would much need to be done fully to dismantle slavery and its white supremacist aftermath.",1
"As things transpired, the run of cases extending Brown through Green and Swann to eliminate school segregation Òroot and branch,Ó came to a halt in Milliken in 1974, when a Court with four recent Nixon appointees held that the affirmative steps mandated earlier were not actually constitutionally required, and that so long as students were free to go to their neighborhood schools, Òequal protection of the lawsÓ was satisfied.",1
"Later decisions not only upheld Milliken, but found that affirmative efforts school boards might take to integrate beyond this were not only not required by the Constitution, but not permitted by it!",1
"Perhaps needless to say, we are no closer today to eliminating white supremacy Òroot and branchÓ than we are to eliminating school desegregation.",1
It is no overstatement to say that what Tommie Shelby calls the Òdark ghettoÓ was itself largely a creation of governmental policies.,1
It is no overstatement to say that what Tommie Shelby calls the Òdark ghettoÓ was itself largely a creation of governmental policies.,1
African-American migrants from the South were permitted to live only in tightly circumscribed neighborhoods in the urban North in housing arrangements that made both exit and the accumulation of wealth virtually impossible.,1
"Job discrimination and later industrial decline left many trapped in increasingly poor, precarious, and dangerous neighborhoods.",1
It seems obvious that rectification of racial injustice will require substantial abolitionist aspects.,1
"Shelby argues that: Éblack metropolitan neighborhoods with high levels of concentrated disadvantage should, on grounds of justice, be abolished.",1
"Ending ghettoization wouldÉ require a radical transformation of the basic structure of U.S. society, andÉ such efforts at fundamental change should include the ghetto poor as essential and equal partners.",1
It seems impossible to eliminate systemic racism root and branch without abolishing ghettoization.,1
"Doing so is, however, consistent with substantial investment in these urban areas, accompanied by enhanced housing, schools, services, and community control.",1
It is consistent also with the kind of integrating measures that Elizabeth Anderson calls for in The Imperative of Integration.,1
"Anderson convincingly argues that it is impossible for individuals in racialized groups to relate to one another as mutually accountable equals unless they encounter one another in daily life Ð in their neighborhoods, parks, and other public spaces.",1
I assume that an abolitionist remedy would involve various other measures as well.,1
"To mention just a few: significantly more aggressive school desegregation Ð utilizing schemes of the kind that school districts employed before Milliken and more recent cases like Parents; affirmative action in institutions of higher learning, justified not by diversity, but as a just response to slavery and its aftermath; and greater access for Black citizens to grants and loans for housing and businesses to address the wealth segregation resulting from housing segregation and other forms of racial discrimination.",1
"Additionally, tort remedies of various kinds are also called for.",1
"In these cases, however, descent from direct victims seems relevant in a way that it is not to the uprooting of forms of racist oppression that afflict Black citizens regardless of their ancestry.",1
A good example might be Georgetown UniversityÕs establishment of a commission to distribute $100 million to benefit descendants of enslaved peoples it once owned.,1
"On the national level, I agree with the ADOS Foundation that descendants of American slavery have a valid claim to substantial reparation of injuries to their ancestors, perhaps along the lines that Boxill argues.",1
"One relevant consideration is that although more recently arrived Black citizens chose to emigrate, those ensnared in American slavery were forced against their will.",1
"The American people thus bear a responsibility for what we might think of as slaveryÕs original theft Ð the kidnapping of Black Africans for American slavery, ripping them from their homes and homelands and depriving them of their history and connections to their families, societies, and lands.",1
But how would individuals establish their descent from enslaved persons?,1
"This can hardly be an insuperable obstacle to reparations if the very reason why it is difficult to prove descent is because of American slavery itself, through the breaking up of families, not sharing records, depriving the enslaved of literacy, and the like.",1
"To the contrary, a just repair must itself include the painstaking research and public history necessary to Òsay the namesÓ of enslaved individuals and establish lines of descent to contemporary Americans.",1
What form might such reparations take?,1
One form that seems appropriate in light of the very idea of descent is to establish bonds for every newborn descendant.,1
"At maturity, the bonds would be available for personal investment.",1
"Rather than restricting them to approved uses, like education, it seems to be most appropriate for them to be unrestricted so that they can symbolize the freedom of which their ancestors were deprived.",1
Establishing lines of descent makes vivid the personal connections between enslaved individuals and individual descendants.,1
"And an accompanying public history also offers the opportunity for inquiry concerning connections of both of these groups and individual white citizens, past and present.",1
This can help bring to life the significant fact that virtually every American has been caught up in white supremacy and bring it to public consciousness in ways that can enable Americans better to come to terms with the enormity of the phenomenon and their own relation to it.,1
To create a just society it is necessary to establish relations of mutual respect and equality between all members.,1
We have been focusing mainly on ways in which individuals have been injured by other individuals and by racist political institutions and policies.,1
"No less important, however, are relations of social dominance and oppression.",1
"It is helpful in understanding the depth and significance of white social supremacy, to consider the idea that Black Americans have been made to wear what the U.S.",1
Supreme Court once termed Òbadges of slaveryÓ in 1883.,1
"By this, the Court meant that legislation and practice concerning slavery had effectively imposed a socially recognizable mark on all Black Americans, whether formally enslaved or not, that labeled them as fit to be enslaved and therefore to be treated and viewed more generally with Òcontempt and pity,Ó as W.E.B. Dubois put it.",1
"To help illuminate the distinctive form of social subordination to which Black citizens have been subjected, it is worth going into this history in some detail.",1
The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution has two sections.,1
"The first runs as follows: Section 1: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.",1
Section 1 thus abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.,1
The second section is much less well known and discussed: Section 2: Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.,1
This is an important addition.,1
There are many intrastate matters that Congress cannot regulate.,1
The Thirteenth AmendmentÕs Section 2 made whatever is necessary to ensure that slavery and involuntary servitude did not continue to exist a federal affair.,1
It removed grounds for complaint in this area that Congress was intruding on matters the Constitution reserved to the states.,1
The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified in 1865.,1
"Under the cover of Section 2, the Congress then passed the Civil Rights Act in 1866, an important step in the political empowerment of the formerly enslaved during Radical Reconstruction.",1
"The Act made central political rights of citizenship independent of ÒraceÓ or Òprevious condition of slavery or involuntary servitude.Ó It also gave Black citizens an assortment of other basic rights, most notably, again, the right not to be discriminated against in housing, which, if it had been secured, would almost certainly have dramatically affected Black AmericanÕs wealth.",1
"In 1883, the Court held that the Thirteenth AmendmentÕs Section 2 only gave Congress the power to address what it called Òbadge[s]Ó and ÒincidentsÓ of slavery.",1
"To deny Black citizens, whether formerly enslaved or not, central political and economic rights, such as the right to enter into contracts, it said, would impermissibly impose on them a Òbadge of slavery,Ó whereas allowing individuals to take account of race in private economic decisions, rental and housing sales, for example, would not.",1
That was what the Court held.,1
What did the Court mean by ÒincidentsÓ and Òbadges of slaveryÓ?,1
"One part of the legal idea that the Court was invoking was that, before Abolition, race had been treated as a legal Òbadge of slaveryÓ in slaveholding states when, for one example, being Black was taken as legally presumptive evidence of being a slave or when, for another, a denial of political rights like the right to vote to the enslaved was also extended to free Blacks because, though formally free, they wore the Òbadge of slaveryÓ since their skin color was taken to be a socially recognizable mark of slave status.",1
"Similarly, in states where Black citizens had been denied the vote because of slavery, this denial was a legal Òincident,Ó that is, a legal consequence, of slavery.",1
"So, according to the CourtÕs reasoning in 1883, Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment gave Congress the power to guarantee former slaves the right to vote, since its prior denial had been a legal consequence of slavery.",1
"In other words, the Court held in 1883 that Section 2 gave Congress the authority to outlaw not just the institution of slavery itself, but also its former legal consequences (ÒincidentsÓ) as well as its socially recognizable, status-defining marks or ÒbadgesÓ.",1
"I have gone into this legal history because I believe that the notions of ÒincidentsÓ and, especially, ÒbadgesÓ of slavery are important for understanding the distinctive forms of social inequality and inferiority to which Black people have been subjected in my country.",1
"Social treatment has been an ineliminable, and arguably the central, aspect of American white supremacy.",1
Relational hierarchy exists when people relate to one another on terms of superiority or inferiority.,1
"It contrasts with relational equality, where people relate to one another as equals.",1
"Arguably, the function of the modern concept of race was to rationalize forms of oppression and subjugation like chattel slavery.",1
So inferiority of a more fundamental (ideologically normative) kind was built into the racial idea of Blackness from the start.,1
"That does not mean, of course, that the concept could not be, or that it has not been, repurposed for other, even emancipatory, uses.",1
But it should be uncontroversial that this was the concept in play in the ideology and practice of American chattel slavery.,1
"Arguably, the function of the modern concept of race was to rationalize forms of oppression and subjugation like chattel slavery.",1
Chattel slavery was a relation of superiority/inferiority that was encoded legally and socially within an institution of property.,1
"What Southerners called their Òpeculiar institutionÓ involved a distinctive form of property in people that gave masters virtually unlimited legal and social authority over their enslaved, including, importantly, mastery over their bodies.",1
"Masters had largely unconstrained powers of command that made deference not only often the only reasonable response, but what defined the social and legal role itself.",1
"Without the Òpeculiar institution,Ó there could have been no Òbadges of slavery,Ó no public signifiers that its bearer is fit to be treated as chattel.",1
"Du Bois said that the Òreal essenceÓ of the Òbadge of colorÓ is Òits social heritage of slavery; the discrimination and insult.Ó But just as slaveryÕs ÒincidentsÓ outlived Abolition, so also did its badges.",1
Both have to be addressed if the legal and the social aspects of slavery are to be overcome.,1
It is no overstatement to say that ghettoization was itself largely a consequence of governmental policies.,1
"Moreover, the governmentÕs dividing children into schools by race and dividing citizens into neighborhoods by race gave them a racial social badge as well.",1
Rothstein shows that many cities were substantially more integrated before governmental actions in the early twentieth century.,1
This means that governmental policy actually added to the badges of slavery.,1
"Even if the government no longer actively supports housing segregation (and its badge of slavery), the American people remain responsible for removing the badge of slavery it created with official housing segregation as well as for eliminating badges of slavery resulting from governmental support of slavery itself.",1
"Earlier I mentioned that housing segregation has brought massive wealth racial inequality in its train, to the extent that it makes sense to say that in the U.S.",1
"today, wealth itself is segregated by race.",1
"Surely this too functions as a badge of slavery, one that turns the phrase Òdeserving poorÓ on its head.",1
"Owing to slavery and its aftermath, Black poverty has become a social signifier of deserving to be poor owing to inferior status, of being someone who is to be viewed, as Du Bois noted, with Òcontempt and pity.Ó The Black body has been socially marked as fit to be owned as chattel, carnally possessed, and subjected to unspeakable indignities.",1
"Moreover, the violence, visceral fear, and violation of the body that characterized slavery and that have been such grievous aspects of African-American life ever since have been both cause and effect of the Black body being made a badge of slavery as well.",1
"The Black body has been socially marked as fit to be owned as chattel, carnally possessed, and subjected to unspeakable indignities.",1
"Can there be any serious doubt that this badge of slavery contributed, and still does contribute, to the history of lynching, racist violence, and violent intimidation that has characterized the African-American experience, and still does, including the police violence that inspired the Black Lives Matter Movement.",1
There are other significant badges of slavery as well.,1
"One obvious one that must be mentioned is the mass incarceration of the last thirty to forty years, most notably of African-American males.",1
"In 1980, 10 percent of Black males who did not complete high school were incarcerated.",1
"By 2008 this number had increased to 37 percent, almost four times the earlier figure.",1
"Today, the chances are roughly one-in-three that a Black male will be imprisoned sometime during his life.",1
Loc Wacquant uses the term ÒhyperincarcerationÓ to refer to the more targeted imprisonment of those in ghettoized urban neighborhoods in the industrial North.,1
"With white as well as middle-class Black urban flight, a progressively challenged social infrastructure, the War on Drugs (partly fought with an increasingly militarized urban police force), and a conservative turn in American politics that decimated social programs, hyperincarceration became AmericaÕs urban policy of choice.",1
Badges of slavery are social signifiers that those who wear them are to be regarded and treated as inferiors.,1
But there is no such thing as inferiority without superiority.,1
So badges of slavery were from the very outset badges of the superiority of those who did not have to wear them.,1
"At first, of course, these were primarily whites in the slaveholding South, but never exclusively.",1
"Even Northern Radical Republican abolitionists were likelier to favor Òcolonization,Ó that is, forced emigration of freed slaves to newly constituted colonies in Africa, than full integration into American society.",1
"ÒBadges of slavery,Ó therefore were, and remain, simultaneously badges of white supremacy, to be seen by those who did and do not bear them as signifying a de jure or normative superiority in order to rationalize de facto racial hierarchy.",1
White social supremacy cannot therefore be abolished without the destruction of the racial social markers or badges that mediate it.,1
And that ultimately cannot be done without undermining the modern concept of race itself.,1
As James Baldwin put it in his 1965 Cambridge Union debate with William F.,1
Buckley: It is a terrible thing for an entire people to surrender to the notion that one-ninth of its population is beneath them.,1
"And until that moment, until the moment comes when we, the Americans, we, the American people, are able to accept the fact, that I have to accept, for example, that my ancestors are both white and Black.",1
"That on that continent we are trying to forge a new identity for which we need each other [and that] I am one of the people who built the country Ð until this moment there is scarcely any hope for the American dream, because the people who are denied participation in it, by their very presence, will wreck it.",1
"The first several times I heard this passage, I took Òthe people who are denied participation in it, by their very presence, will wreck itÓ to be a strategic remark, along the lines of: continued oppression will bring Òthe fire next time.Ó But that is not what Baldwin is saying, I think.",1
His point is that Òthe very presenceÓ of a racially subjugated group in relation to which those in the subjugating group identify themselves (as superior) is sufficient by itself to undermine any ÒAmerican DreamÓ worth wanting for both groups.,1
Baldwin emphasizes that white supremacy distorts the lives of white oppressors as well as those of their victims.,1
"ÒThe degree of civilization in a societyÓ said Dostoevsky, Òcan be judged by entering its prisonsÓ Ð and, we might add ÒÉ by the process of re-entry, when incarcerated persons return.Ó In April 2023, we convened a group of post-incarcerated individuals and philosophy professors with experience of prison teaching to discuss imprisonment and re-entry.",1
"Our post-incarcerated participants had taken college-level classes while in prison, and often found it immensely valuable, sometime even life-saving.",1
But why should philosophical reflection end simply because one had been released from the carceral ÒcaveÓ?,1
"If anything, we suspected that the experience of Òre-entryÓ would be so challenging, fraught with contradictions, and displacing after years of isolation from mainstream society and new technologies, that it might be very helpful to reflect together on the experience.",1
"This research into displacement might also, we hoped, be philosophically illuminating in and of itself, and relevant to displaced others; refugees, those newly unemployed, people making big life changes, etc.",1
"Finally, our group aimed to set up a space of mutual support by gathering people who, by circumstance or court order, are often unable to connect with others who have also recently been released.",1
Yet it is precisely those facing similar situations who might be most understanding and helpful.,1
"The public philosophers who first convened the gathering live in Baltimore (in the United States) and Toronto (in Canada), so the happy consequence was an international discussion that looked at individual experiences with two carceral systems.",1
"Among our fifteen or so participants we ended up with an equal gender division and a rich ethnic, racial and age mix.",1
"We later called ourselves ÒRe-imagining Re-entry: The Public Philosophy Group.Ó We met via Zoom, and used its auto-transcription capacities to hold onto the discussions.",1
"Our first session was organized around a reading of phenomenologist O. F. BollnowÕs article on ÒLived-SpaceÓ; our second used excerpts from James BaldwinÕs ÒMy Dungeon Shook: A Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation.Ó The first contribution below is synthesized out of the group discussion by Kym Maclaren of Toronto Metropolitan University, and explores what it is to have a home and how prisons can both offer a qualified sense of home, and also ÒunhomeÓ a person.",1
"Tiina Eldridge then offers a personal reflection on how oneÕs sense of home, even upon release, can be confounded and confused by prison life and the society one finds beyond it.",1
"Next, Drew Leder of Loyola University Maryland, guided by group discussion, reflects on the multiple paradoxes that attend, and often block the success of, the Òre-entry experience.Ó Zakaria AmaraÕs piece offers a more intimate look at various challenges that he has faced in getting out of prison and making his way in the outside world.",1
"Finally, Randall Bagley points out various mystifications that can keep people in and outside of prisons Òin the cave,Ó as he advocates for education.",1
"We hope these reflections are compelling and illuminative, of both philosophical and human interest.",1
They analyze the severe challenges associated both with long-term incarceration and then a jarring and obstructed re-entry process.,1
"This certainly should lead us to question the methods used in the carceral state and, most importantly, to search together for humanistic alternatives.",1
"The self, phenomenology has taught us, is not some hidden inward ghost-like substance, but an embodied engagement with the world.",1
"Such engagement is, however, a two-sided process.",1
"On the one hand, it involves an encounter with a beyond, with what is foreign, other, not yet comprehended Ð that which puts oneself and oneÕs familiar ways of making sense into question.",1
"On the other hand, we are challenged by this foreignness only because we have come to occupy established ways of making sense, a sphere of familiarity, a place wherein one knows how things work, who one is, and where one stands Ð in short, a home.",1
"Home, as Kirsten Jacobson has argued, is where we gather and consolidate ourselves; the sphere of foreignness is where we are called to transform ourselves and make ourselves anew; and it is only because we can recollect ourselves in our home, because it holds, reflects, and shelters us, because it gives us a place, that we have the strength and resources to take on the new, to make new sense of ourselves and the world, to find new ways of being.",1
Home is our anchor point within reality which gives us orientation and allows us to set out in new directions.,1
Home is our anchor point within reality which gives us orientation and allows us to set out in new directions.,1
"For many of us, such a home might be found in our place of residence, where furniture, decorations, and resources are organized in terms of our own projects and values: this is a place to which we feel we can withdraw in order to rest and gather ourselves, for the space itself holds us, speaks of us, maintains us, and we do not need to act in order to realize ourselves or work in order to remember ourselves.",1
"But home might also be a landscape, a group of other people, perhaps even a set of musical soundscapes Ð whatever it is that returns us to ourselves, replenishes us, prepares us to once again venture out into the unknown.",1
"Prison, intentionally or not, functions essentially to unhome a person.",1
"Deemed guilty of an offence against society, one is exiled, taken away from oneÕs people, oneÕs house, oneÕs familiar daily paths of action.",1
"One is put in a generic cell, perhaps with a stranger one would never choose to live with, and subjected to a schedule and routine in which one has no or little say.",1
"For the most part, one is denied the furnishings, clothes, spaces, and activities through which one previously expressed and found oneself.",1
"The purported reasons for imprisonment are manifold: security, punishment, rehabilitation, and an opportunity to turn inwards, to reflect on who one has been, and to transform oneself.",1
"But these reasons are contradictory, for what makes prison a punishment is equally what works to undermine self-transformation: exile, or stripping one of all that allows one to feel at home and to find oneself is equally taking away that refuge in which we forge the strength, resolve and resources to move out into the beyond and to learn to be ourselves in new ways.",1
"It makes sense, then, that people who are incarcerated will seek to establish a sense of home within prison Ð both for the sake of gathering themselves, and for the sake of transforming themselves.",1
"As Rachel Fayter says, ÒI made my living unit and cell into a home, and even referred to it that way at times.",1
And it wasnÕt because I felt particularly comfortable or safe.,1
"It was just kind of a human need to have a space to call home.Ó Natasha Warren spoke of putting up her own artwork in order to make her cell feel more homey, and Amanda Hill found it important to keep changing the pictures on her wall: ÒI needed to make it reflect my continuing growth,É And then, when it started feeling old again, I would do something different to stay on top of my freedom.Ó In these ways, people found they could eke out a little space in prison that was their place, a place of holding, refuge, support.",1
"Indeed, for some, prison could even feel in some ways safer, more home-like than the violent situations from which they came.",1
"As Tiina Aila Eldridge notes, Òwhen I went to prison, that was the first time where I wasnÕt actually at a threat of physical violence.",1
"So, it kind of seemed like a safe placeÉ, and it wasnÕt a safe place, of course, but it was just free from the threat that was always there for all of my life.Ó Ultimately, however, prison unhomes in more ways than simply by exiling a person.",1
"As Laura McMahon has argued in her essay ÒHome InvasionsÓ (2014), precisely because we make our homes in external things Ð in spaces, with pictures, through the ways we set things up Ð our homes and the selves that they hold and shelter are vulnerable to violations.",1
And prison practices make use of precisely these violations.,1
"As Nathan relates, Òno matter how much of a home you try to make your cell, or whatever space youÕre in at any given time, you know the correctional officers can come in and walk in there with their boots on your bed, root through your pictures, rip them off the wall, tear them Òby accidentÓ, throw stuff on the floor, put stuff in your sink or toilet Òby accidentÓ, rummage through your food with their gloves, not even your own body belongs to you.Ó What might look like mere destruction of property is in fact the denial of any space for the self in this environment.",1
It is an unhoming.,1
"As Nathan says, Òif something occurs within that home thatÕs a violation to your sanity, to your integrity, to your values, to who you are as a person, I mean: is that a home?Ó The very place that establishes a sanctuary for the self is simultaneously, because it holds and sustains the self, a place of great vulnerability.",1
This is the truth of all homes; but prisons tend to prey on that vulnerability.,1
"The resilience of many incarcerated people is such that, in the face of this vulnerability, they find still new ways to make a home.",1
"As Zak Amara says, Òhuman beings have the remarkable ability to create a home wherever they may beÓ, and if the spaces one makes over into a home are regularly violated, then people turn inwards, to establish a sense of home in what cannot be taken from them Ð in their mental space.",1
"As Lorraine Pinnock notes, ÒIÕve never pinned down one place and said Ôthis is my homeÕÉ because tomorrow there may be a hurricane, you know, and your space is goneÉ so if you were to go into that space that they put me in, you would never see any personal effects whatsoever, because my home has always been something mental.Ó Natasha agrees: Òhome is myself wherever I amÓ and Amanda describes her version of this: ÒAs a spiritual person, I knew how to stay grounded: in whatever situation, I found the balance in it that would work for me, and that kept me in a sense of safety and belonging like I was okay and at peaceÉ I was home within my own self.Ó Like many others, Amanda discovered that Òreading books and learning was the world of freedom that I had control over, and nobody could take that from me.Ó Randall Bagley Jr.",1
"concurs: Òmy way of staying sane for my 24 years of incarceration was that I carved out a niche in my own mind that made me feel comfortable; É for me reading and learning allow me to build that space, to travel within the confines of my prison cell.Ó Have we then arrived at the conclusion that, contra phenomenologyÕs notion of the self as being-in-the-world, the selfÕs real sanctuary and home is inwardness and the mental space that no one else can put their boots on?",1
"Certainly, the experiences of incarcerated individuals highlight the power and importance of the selfÕs ability to withdraw inward, but if the philosopher of embodiment, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, is right, this inner solitude is not separable from an embodied, vulnerable self that exists in and through the things of the shared world.",1
"This becomes evident, within the experience of incarceration, in individualsÕ concerns with ÒinstitutionalizationÓ.",1
"The problem is this: though one might withdraw into a home within oneÕs own mind, one still needs to navigate the material space of prison.",1
"One must decide whether one acts in accordance with what the prison wants, so as to be as comfortable as possible, or whether one resists.",1
"And if one acts so as to create comfort and ease, then, in John WoodlandÕs words, one is becoming Òinstitutionalized: one has bought into what the department of corrections wants inmates to do, one is trying to make a home.",1
But this place is insanity.,1
"This is no place to become comfortable with.Ó In other words, though one may withdraw into oneÕs mental world, one also needs to live in the material world.",1
"And how one lives there has an impact upon who and how one is, upon oneÕs self.",1
"Though one might withdraw into a home within oneÕs own mind, one still needs to navigate the material space of prison.",1
Earlier we saw that home is both a place of security and vulnerability.,1
Now we see a second ambiguity: home is both what can open you to new becomings and what can close you off from such becoming.,1
"JohnÕs concern with institutionalization is that, in adjusting to the demands of the prison, and coming to be at home in them, one develops a way of being oneself that fits within prison but will make establishing a new home beyond prison much more difficult.",1
"Kirsten Jacobson makes a similar point about home, using the example of travel: The habits of our lived bodies, our Ôhome bodies' are so deep that we typically find our home Ð our way of being in the world Ð anywhere we go, and often thickly or even overwhelmingly so, Even if we have sought out what we take to be a truly foreign placeÉ we will commonly import our routine ways of looking and our habits of choice into our destination, and as such we remain rooted in our [past] home.",1
"Though withdrawal into the spaces of our own ideas, imaginings, and spirituality grants us a certain invulnerability and freedom, then, we remain embodied beings who must put ourselves out into the world, and how we settle into that world may leave us more or less open to that which will solicit transformations, changes, becoming.",1
"The homes that we establish in and through our daily practices can, in other words, become prisons themselves.",1
"This is the difficult situation that those in prison face: how does one establish, within prison, a sense of home which can be a sanctuary of the self, without submitting one to constant violation, and without establishing a way of being that closes one off from new becomings and productive transformations?",1
"For many, the answer to navigating these difficulties has turned out to be community: ÒitÕs really for me the people that help me feel at homeÓ (Rachel).",1
"Of course, other people can also make one feel substantially not at home.",1
"Randall noted that, upon being released from prison, he found himself ÒhomeÓ amongst family and friends who Òexpected me to be the man I was 24 years agoÉ so home is not a home for meÓ.",1
"But if one finds others who can recognize who one is, who can hold open a space for one to be oneself and to become who one is becoming, who can even remind one what one cares about and help one recollect oneselfÉ this is perhaps the most powerful sense of home.",1
Randall found this sense of home in a community of learners within prison: Òeverybody was trying to get an education.,1
Everybody was there for a common purpose.,1
It enabled me to see a vision of something better.,1
"So, I was able to feel that sense of home in that sense of togetherness, and it was all created by a sense of purpose.Ó Rachel found that home on the outside required finding others who had lived through (or worked hard to understand) the experience of incarceration, because only they could really hold open a space that reflected who she had been and was becoming.",1
"And many of our interlocutors spoke of the importance they saw in making space for others: Òone of the most important things for me when I was released was creating a space, creating a home, so that individuals with lived experiences such as mine could come into my space and feel security in that room, love, and an environment that smelled of pleasant food and positive energyÓ (Earl Young).",1
"This sanctuary with others is a home that, though it has its own kinds of vulnerabilities, is not something that correctional officers can put their boots on, or ÒaccidentallyÓ throw in the toilet.",1
"And a sanctuary with others is also a place where, if we are truly making space for the others to be who they are becoming, we will always also find ourselves opening out to Ð and being challenged by Ð what exceeds us, rather than finding this home a new prison.",1
ItÕs been ten and a half years since I was released from prison.,1
I still live in the same tiny bachelor apartment IÕve been in since I was released from the halfway house.,1
"There is nothing on my walls and I have made no effort to decorate, yet this is my home and the place IÕve lived the longest.",1
"When I was first incarcerated, I was withdrawing from heroin, violently ill with no medical support, in disbelief of what was happening to me and in a delusional/fugue state.",1
"One very intense memory I have is lying on my cot in a segregation cell and on the ceiling, someone had drawn a doorway with a small door on the bottom labeled Òdoggie door.Ó Having just had my dog pried out of my arms during arrest, I stared up at the door and kept telling myself that I would be okay because one day I would have an apartment and a dog again.",1
I think of that so much still as I look around this tiny bachelor apartment and I am so grateful for this space.,1
I got my dog too.,1
"Sadly, he passed away recently, almost ten years to the day after I moved in here.",1
"I have a new dog now, she is the sweetest puppy ever; it is definitely not a home to me if I am not sharing it with a dog.",1
I think I may be ready to move and make a home.,1
I have rent saved and have been looking at furniture and dishes and decorations.,1
"Almost everything I have here was donated to me when I first moved by kind, caring people.",1
Why has it taken me so long?,1
I think I have been confounded by what a home is and what a home means by my experiences.,1
"Before going to prison, I experienced a period of homelessness.",1
"Prior to living here, prison was the longest place IÕd lived Ð even though I was moved around so much while inside.",1
"We have no choice but to internalize not getting attached to spaces and people because at any moment you will hear the words, ÒEldridge pack your shit.Ó Now, more than ever, people are being returned to the community and the reality is, they may likely never have a home.",1
"ItÕs further confused and convoluted because now, more than ever, people are being returned to the community and the reality is, they may likely never have a home.",1
"They can be put in a shelter, which is extremely similar to prison and be considered Òhoused.Ó But isnÕt genuine homelike housing a basic human right?",1
"I have worked in shelters and with unhoused people for many years and I often feel guilty for wanting a bigger space, for having a soft fluffy duvet to snuggle in every night and for having an expensive parka to keep me warm.",1
I donÕt know if I will ever know what home means or if I feel I deserve one.,1
Over the years I have been a volunteer teacher of philosophy usually in maximum security settings.,1
"Most of my students were serving life or very long-term sentences, sometimes for crimes committed in their youth.",1
"In the American culture of punitive mass incarceration, for close to thirty years I had seen precious few of these students released.",1
"This, however, has started to change with the sheer passage of time, reconsideration of certain cases, and MarylandÕs Juvenile Restoration Act seeking to reduce life-sentences for juvenile crimes.",1
"For the first time, I actually found myself interacting with ex-students on the outside.",1
"This made me consider more deeply what society calls Òre-entry.Ó Could philosophy, which seemed to be of great value to my prison students, also speak to those undergoing the rough transitions that follow release?",1
"And what did I and others have to learn from these individuals, often highly reflective, about the phenomenology of the re-entry experience, and their strategies for survival?",1
"I will focus on key points of our classroom conversation, going back and forth between my voice and that of classmates.",1
"First, certain individuals did experience support in their attempts to negotiate their difficult transitions.",1
This makes sense: The wider society presumably has a vested interest in ex-prisoners becoming law-abiding tax-paying citizens.,1
"Randall Bagley, Jr. spoke of the intellectual and social resources provided by a Georgetown University degree-granting program he began while in prison and was able to continue with after release.",1
"Keven Simmons, living in the Toronto area, noted that during his job search no less than 29 of 30 people interacted with him positively, and even that last one ended up providing crucial assistance.",1
"However, such accounts were more the exceptions than the general rule.",1
Many spoke of encountering significant obstructions in their search for personal and social success.,1
"Natasha Warren describes her interaction with her parole officer thus: I told her what my dreams were, and like that I wanted to work with this homeless population (and) with female offenders that get out of prison, and she told me that thatÕs a pipedream.",1
IÕm never going to accomplish it.,1
IÕm never going to do anything with my lifeÉand I should just accept it.,1
"I just couldn't believe how beat down that she made me tried to make me feel, but it just made me stronger.",1
"Zakaria Amara describes meeting with his parole officer supervisor to discuss relaxing Internet restrictions: ÒAt the end, I simply asked for access to a job-finding site and word processing, and even that she wouldnÕt agree to.",1
She said that she was surprised that I was even released.,1
And that I got a bank account.Ó Rachel Fayter describes having Òthe exact same experience.,1
"I had a parole officer say to me, Ôwhy are you going to grad school?",1
Why donÕt you just go work at McDonaldÕs like a regular Joe?,1
"Why you gotta go to school?Õ IÕm like seriously, youÕre discouraging me from getting an education, what the fuck?Ó Lorraine Pinnock talks about securing a job at a hospital working with HIV patients (she needed to show employment as a condition of parole): I got the wrath of corrections, and the halfway house, brought down on me, because apparently the job paid way above a minimum wage, and it was paying more than what the parole officer and the people at the halfway house was making.",1
"I was told that you know people in my position donÕt make those sort of wages, and I must have done something illegal to have gained this employment.",1
These released individuals are subject to what Marilyn Frye speaks of as a double-bind structure characteristic in general of oppressive systems.,1
"For example, a woman in a sexist society might be defined as a ÒprudeÓ if she does not engage in sexual activity or a ÒslutÓ if she does.",1
"She is, so to speak, damned if she does and damned if she doesnÕt, meeting with conflicting expectations and the likelihood of censure.",1
"Similarly, these ex-prisoners are told to secure an education and job, often as a condition of parole and indication of their successful re-entry.",1
"Yet, at the same time they meet with censure for doing so.",1
"This structural double-bind can often be internalized in the form of psychological confusion, self-doubt, and inhibition.",1
"Oppressive power works very powerfully, as Foucault explores in Discipline and Punish, when it is internalized in systems of self-limitation.",1
Oppressive power works very powerfully when it is internalized in systems of self-limitation.,1
"Along with experiencing obstacles to going forward in their lives, there is also the threat of going backward, particularly for those under parole that can always be revoked.",1
"As Randall Bagley, Jr. says: You walk around with this constant fear, looking over your shoulder, looking over your back.",1
They know your situation.,1
You all over the news.,1
"They can just say, okay, he did this, and theyÕll lock you back up Ð so itÕs like a constant fear of going back.",1
"While support may not be offered by the larger society, perhaps one might find this through allying with others also going through re-entry.",1
"They are in the best position to understand oneÕs experience, commiserate, provide encouragement, as well as useful tips and information.",1
"However, in many cases such contacts are viewed as suspicious or outrightly forbidden.",1
"As Rachel Fayter notes, those recently released are not Òallowed to associate with other criminalized people.Ó These accounts seem to demonstrate a deep social ambivalence Ð etymologically, to have strong forces pointed in two ways Ð concerning Òre-entry.Ó On the one hand, these are people who have served their time, often in exemplary fashion, and now deserve freedom.",1
"Instead of costing the state, they are given the chance and encouragement to be positive contributors.",1
Yet they still retain the sticky designation of Òex-criminals.Ó Despite the prefix of negation (ÒexÓ meaning Òno moreÓ) the compound word reasserts their ÒcriminalÓ identity as central and inescapable.,1
"A single act in the past continues to define who they were, are, and what they may manifest again Ð again, that essential criminality.",1
"They are thus subjected to what Foucault would term a disciplinary structure operating through perpetual surveillance and a microphysics of control, one that echoes the carceral state.",1
"In addition to the literal halfway house that Lorraine Pinnock mentions, this thus constitutes a kind of metaphorical Òhalfway houseÓ for all undergoing re-entry.",1
"That is, those released are now half free citizens, yet half not.",1
"They are encouraged to go forward, but simultaneously obstructed in those efforts.",1
As Kafka writes in The Trial: Before the Law stands a doorkeeper on guard.,1
To this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law.,1
But the doorkeeper says that he cannot admit the man at the momentÉ.,1
"The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later.",1
"ÒIt is possible,Ó answers the doorkeeper, Òbut not at this moment.Ó [Finally] The doorkeeper perceives that the man is at the end of his strength and that his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: ÒNo one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended only for you.",1
I am now going to shut it.Ó This in certain ways characterizes the situation of the released prisoner.,1
They are told there is a door that offers you full admittance to the goods of the wider society.,1
"Yet at the same time, that door is guarded, obstructed in multiple ways.",1
This is surely one factor that helps to account for the high rate of recidivism: one U.S.,1
study showed that 68% of released prisoners were arrested for a new crime within three years.,1
"Of course, at that point, the prison door again clangs shut, the doorway to true freedom remaining perpetually out of reach.",1
"Happily, that is not the end of the story for many.",1
Foucault himself acknowledges that no power structure is totalizing: there are always modes of available resistance.,1
"As Brent Pickett notes of FoucaultÕs later work, ÒHere the idea of resistance is connected to the Nietzschean ideal of aesthetic self-creation.",1
"Through practical engagement it is possible to work upon the self, and to create more ÔspaceÕ for self-creation apart from the political world.Ó Moreover, Òthese various elements of resistance are compatible with a range of practical political engagements, such as broadly liberal or even anarchist positions.Ó The prison experience, while traumatic and coercive, also made the survivors strong and resourceful in a variety of ways that they can use to negotiate the trials they face post-release.",1
"I will now turn to those strategies, personal and political, that individuals spoke of as helping them survive, even thrive, despite the paradoxes and double binds of re-entry.",1
"The prison experience, while traumatic and coercive, also made the survivors strong and resourceful in a variety of ways that they can use to negotiate the trials they face post-release.",1
It is as if these are men and women who have graduated from the most challenging of universities; sometimes even being a lifer teaches you how best to face life.,1
"In response to a question as what one might write to someone newly released, Zakaria Amara said: They [those on the outside] have no idea how nearly impossible it was for you to convince all those bureaucrats that they wouldnÕt lose their jobs if they released you.",1
"YouÕre a champion in my eyes, and you should celebrate this incredible achievement.",1
"Having said that as a friend and as someone who has walked the same path, I must let you know that the battle is only half won.",1
"As a former convict, you might as well be walking out of those gates with the sign of the Antichrist stamped on your forehead.",1
Anytime you apply for a job or try to meet someone new it will glow red.,1
"Some people can see past it, but unfortunately, most canÕt.",1
So youÕre going to have to be patient.,1
"But more importantly, youÕre gonna have to be creative by rewriting the story that society has written about you and turning it into a monumental bestseller.",1
"This rewriting, from what I heard in class, involves multiple resistances to defining oneself as an Òex-criminal.Ó As previously mentioned, the ÒcriminalÓ part of the word labels you in purely negative terms, equating self with the worst of your actions.",1
The ÒexÓ highlights the fact that you are no longer who you were: a declaration of discontinuity.,1
"Hence Òex-criminalÓ is a negation of a negation, but one that, unlike a mathematical formula, does not really give rise to a positive solution.",1
"Instead, class members focused on the fundamentally positive nature of who they were, and continuities in their sense of self which had been forged in the crucible of long-term confinement.",1
"John Woodland, Jr. told the story of his employment in a treatment center where he was asked to deal with the clients as if they were incarcerated.",1
He began to feel like a correctional officer himself.,1
Then he started to break the rules.,1
"Instead of commanding everyone on the unit outside when it was time for a smoke break, as he was required to, he simply let the non-smokers stay inside.",1
"Noting the very limited amount of coffee and sugar allotted was often gone by 3 pm, he started bringing in more.",1
"Those in the unit asked him why he did this: I say, man, IÕve been in the same situation you are, and I know how you feel, and my personal philosophy is, I treat everybody like a human being the way I wanted to be treated.",1
But the minute you started to treat me less than a human being then me and you will start to part our ways because IÕm not gonna let anybody do that to me.,1
"These values, for John Woodland, Jr., are fundamental to his identity.",1
"They help determine how he wishes to be treated, and how he treats others, even within dehumanizing systems.",1
"His challenge is not to change to fit the world, but to remain allied to his own fundamental values and identity.",1
"Moreover, counter to the notion that oneÕs task is to integrate into a well-functioning society, we see John giving an example of the need to challenge and change aspects of that society.",1
"Those experiencing re-entry retain the clarity of the outsiderÕs perspective, having been spatially and temporally isolated for so long.",1
They notice decay in neighborhoods they grew up in; our strange immersion in smartphones that stop people from seeing and talking with one another; the injustices and micro-aggressions that plague their and othersÕ lives.,1
"This can bring about a reversal of perspective: rather than seeking to change their criminal selves to fit in to the well-functioning society, class-members emphasized the importance of being change-agents for a society that itself can be callous, unjust, even criminal.",1
Colie talked about the importance of embodying in yourself the change you want to see in the world.,1
"Randall Bagley, Jr. notes you canÕt just sit around waiting for a system to change: you have to Òtake the bull by the hornsÓ or nothing will ever happen.",1
"John Woodland, Jr. tells of one such initiative that speaks both to the question of societal change and the import of community for the one newly coming home.",1
"In 2012 when some 200 long-term prisoners were released en masse in Maryland due to a legal ruling, this resulted in a kind of social experiment with reverberating outcomes: They got jobs.",1
"They start working in the community and doing positive things, and it changed the attitude of many people in the criminal justice system.",1
"The governor, judges, prosecutors, they start to have a different view of someone with a life sentence, and the rest of us who benefited from their actions when they were released had decided that, hey, weÕre gonna continue to do the same thing.",1
"They now are looking at guys incarcerated and saying, letÕs see about giving this guy a chanceÉThey donÕt even call us convicts anymore.",1
They call us returning citizens.,1
"John describes organizations that were formed to help people after release, barbecues, special events held just for returning citizens and their friends and families.",1
"Thus, in the face of the paradoxes, double-binds, and obstructions that characterize the re-entry process, people do find ways to succeed.",1
"These messages are of benefit to many of us who face obstacles, whether it is a chronic illness, loss of a job, forced emigration, etc.",1
"IÕll give Rachel Fayter the last word here: ThereÕs going to be a lot of challenges along the way, and people youÕll encounter could tell you that youÕre unworthy.",1
"Sometimes you might feel like giving up and conforming to the narrative that was ascribed to you, running away or returning to your cage.",1
"But youÕre also going to meet people that will help you on your journey, understand your struggle, and have walked the same path and overcame the same obstacles.",1
Always remember that youÕre worthy and you deserve to be treated with compassion and kindness.,1
"You have value and knowledge to share with the world, and never let anyone tell you youÕre undeserving.",1
Know what you stand for and where you came from.,1
This wonÕt be easy.,1
ThereÕll be many forks in the road.,1
"Reach out to people, build a supportive community around you and once youÕve found your footing, do your best to support others who are struggling on this journey.",1
"Remember, youÕre not alone, and your life matters.",1
"True, Dostoevsky said, Òthe degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.Ó But I would say that looking into AmericaÕs prisons in order to grasp a sense of anything would be a gigantic waste of time.",1
Better to start with PlatoÕs allegory of the cave.,1
"Men are chained up, facing a wall where they see puppet shadows, but believe this to be reality.",1
"Someone makes it out of the cave and sees the true light, but they are not received well when they return to the cave to help others.",1
"When the news station gains access, or the auditors come in to inspect their business, the prison administrators make sure the prison looks habitable for humans.",1
"ItÕs like making a film, like the puppet-shadows on the wall of PlatoÕs cave.",1
"However, once the director yells ÒcutÓ on the presentation, it is as if the director is also referring to the three hot meals an inmate is supposed to be afforded by law, cleaning supplies, and other simple amenities that should be provided for any human being that lives in a country with an estimated GDP of $20.9 trillion annually.",1
Then there are problems with those on the outside.,1
"For example, there are professionals sitting around teaching students how to exploit marginalized people.",1
They call it Òdigital marketing.Ó This is another meaningful example of PlatoÕs allegory of the cave.,1
Professors are being paid healthy salaries to teach students how to exploit the very people they claim to want to help.,1
"Imagine all the millions of people looking at the shadows on the cave wall, these marketing images, and thinking these financial institutions care about the members of the communities they service.",1
"When I had the opportunity to converse meaningfully with a beautiful panel of such Òpeople who genuinely care,Ó the word ÒaccountabilityÓ kept dancing through my mindÕs eye.",1
"I think that if more people accepted their truth, and were willing to share it (like the man who left but then came back in the cave) we could get to a place of solving problems as opposed to reintroducing them into our conversations under different headings.",1
The reason why I intoned ÒaccountabilityÓ is that people all over the world have a similar opinion about the state of the marginalized people in America.,1
"However, things donÕt change, certain conversations canÕt even be properly broached, because of influential people being Òsilenced by The Powers that be.Ó I think only education, prison education included, brings greater truth Ð gets people out of the cave, bringing truth back into it Ð and is the key to a more sustainable way of life for marginalized people.",1
Prison education is a valuable investment in a more sustainable future for everybody.,1
"I think only education, prison education included, brings greater truth and is the key to a more sustainable way of life for marginalized people.",1
Prison education played the most pivotal role in my being released from the Òcave.Ó Before getting accepted into the Georgetown University BLA (Bachelor of Liberal Arts program) I didnÕt know that I was existing in a perpetual state of ignorance.,1
"I labeled it ÒLiving Dead, Dumb, and BlindÓ Ð once I became comfortable with philosophy.",1
"My ears were once dead to advice and wise counsel; I was dumb to the fact that I was in desperate need of a leader, teacher, and cultivator to help me become aware of the state of being I existed in (the cave); I was blind to the opportunities afforded to those who have taken the time to use the cave (maximum security prison) like the wise men of old, that is, to take account of oneÕs self and resolve to grow, mature, and accept accountability in an effort to re-write the narrative of a returning citizen.",1
"As an ÒescapeeÕÓ from the cave I now must enlighten, encourage, and inspire, as Plato so masterfully did in The Republic.",1
"For almost twenty years, I was a criminal defence attorney, representing people who had been sentenced to prison, sometimes for life.",1
"I was passionate about my work and about my clientsÑwomen and men who may have committed terrible acts in the past and were in prison for decades or even the rest of their lives, but who are also thoughtful, compassionate and hard-working.",1
"I believe that if judges, prosecutors and legislators could see people behind bars as real individuals, they would rethink the carceral system in general and policies that lock people away forever.",1
"I first began using my camera for advocacy purposes when I was the pro bono attorney for Judith Clark, a woman who had been in prison for thirty-three years and would die there unless I could persuade the governor to grant her clemency.",1
"Although I hadnÕt picked up a camera in decades, I decided to take portraits of women who had been incarcerated with Judy and have them write about her influence on their lives as a way of humanizing her.",1
People who saw that work were surprised at the seeming ÒordinarinessÓ of the women.,1
"Their reaction made me realize the power of photography as an advocacy tool and sent me down a now ten-year long path of chronicling women with life sentences, both inside and outside prison.",1
I want to visually show that people with life sentences are regular people who should be treated with compassion and respect.,1
I have now photographed over 50 women with life sentences.,1
Some have come home from prison; some still remain behind bars.,1
"I incorporate the womenÕs handwritten thoughts and reflections; their words are varied and unique, showing their individuality and humanity.",1
I hope you will ask yourself: What do we do with a redeemed life?,1
"With relatively few exceptions and across all fields, careerist concerns have always exercised a parasitical relationship upon artistic authenticity.",1
"From music to literary fiction to the visual arts, instead of facilitating original expression and legitimate talent, too often marketing apparatchiks, surreptitiously adopting the guise of artists themselves, stand poised to interfere with and muddy the streams of pure creativity.",1
"Particularly susceptible to this artistic toxification is the comedic genre, in part perhaps due to the scant empirical criteria required of the profession.",1
"That is to say, a virtuosic guitar player could theoretically try his or her hand at a few jokes between songs, but a standup comedian with no musical aptitude would be hard-pressed to make an equivalent transition.",1
"Although this phenomenon within the comedy industry is by no means a new one, the current technocratic landscape has made such desperate opportunism more starkly evident.",1
"Terms such as ÒviralÓ and ÒinfluencerÓ, for example, as indifferently abstract as they are in tone, can at least be acknowledged for stripping away the pretence that a good majority of comedians today are striving for anything deeper than hits, shares, likes, or whatever else might be grouped under the heading of narcissistic recognition.",1
"As a result, most true connoisseurs of comedy will find the contemporary landscape exceedingly misleading.",1
A new generation of performers culled from the cutely-monikered platforms of TikTok and Instagram are punctuating their curricula vitae with numbers of online followers as if such mathematics reveal anything at all about comedic craftsmanship and insight.,1
"Meanwhile, for over a decade now, almost the entirety of live comedy bookings in the United Kingdom have been arranged through a solitary, members-only ÒPro Comedy GigsÓ Facebook page.",1
"From this platform, club bookers, most of these comedians themselves, having waived any interest in personally curating their own shows, lazily opt instead to select their line-ups through comments left on their posts as if chucking out so many breadcrumbs to a flock of starving pigeons.",1
"The implication, of course, is that comedy is an amorphous and indefinable substance that merely requires the right algorithmic jostling to give it form and function.",1
"Unsurprisingly, the offline comedic world of today offers little respite from its digital counterpart.",1
"Former award-winning sitcom creator Graham Linehan, still nominally operating under the label of comedy writer, now divides his creative time between political chat show appearances and histrionic all-night tweeting about the rise of transgenderism.",1
"In fact, one of LinehanÕs regular outlets, the conservative propaganda television channel GB News, features a rotating stock of hosts, performers, and producers all culled from Comedy Unleashed, a self-proclaimed free speech live comedy night in London.",1
"In the meantime, for those who eschew faux political outrage and crave instead the artificial comforts of televised domesticity, viewers can re-watch comedian Noel Fielding learning how to bake a cake on Channel 4 or comedienne Sara Pascoe learning how to sew a quilt on the BBC.",1
"To anyone with even the most cursory appreciation of the by-now antiquated denotation of the word ÒcomedyÓ, there seems to be very little of it evidenced by its contemporary crop of practitioners, both veterans and novices alike.",1
"This last winter, Stewart Lee, the doyen of the modern alternative comedy scene, was hired by the Royal Shakespeare Company to further their dual aims of undermining the BardÕs artistic authority and underestimating their audienceÕs literary intelligence by contemporising the ÒPorter SceneÓ from Macbeth to include five-year old references to Boris Johnson and his pole-dancing mistress, Jennifer Arcuri.",1
"Elsewhere on the live circuit, one of the more shameless offerings from 2023Õs Edinburgh Festival Fringe was ÒA Show for Gareth RichardsÓ, a night purportedly set up to eulogise a comedian who died earlier that year, but which to a more cynical eye seemed designed to offer a convenient theme for awards committees as well as ten high-profile minutes of stage time each for a swarm of still living comedians.",1
"All the while shows navel gazing on the race, gender, sexual orientation, or physical disabilities of the performer have now been forced to compete against a new vogue of spurious mental health confessionals.",1
"To anyone with even the most cursory appreciation of the by-now antiquated denotation of the word ÒcomedyÓ, there seems to be very little of it evidenced by its contemporary crop of practitioners, both veterans and novices alike.",1
"There are orchestrated acts of political outrage from either side of the illusory left-right spectrum, the smirking coziness of mainstream radio and television success, tragedian tugs at collective heartstrings, and now scores of psychiatric self-diagnoses, but nothing resembling an aesthetic appreciation of an ancient meaning and objective to comedy.",1
Newcomers anxious to bypass talent in pursuit of recognition and old-timers neglecting craftsmanship in favour of careerism each appear to embody the ethos of Graham ChapmanÕs officious Colonel character from ÒMonty PythonÕs Flying CircusÓ: Nobody likes a good laugh more than I do.,1
Except perhaps my wife and some of her friends.,1
"Oh, yes, and Captain Johnson.",1
"Come to think of it, most people like a good laugh more than I do.",1
"It is incumbent on the discerning aesthete of the comedic craft, therefore, to push aside any misleading industry-based contemporary ornamentation as a first step towards establishing whether there is now or ever has been an objective and universal aim to comedy.",1
"Many, undoubtedly, have argued and will continue to argue that comedy is solely a matter of subjective taste, in the process indiscriminately conflating the vocation of comedy with the various approaches of each purported comedian.",1
"In this taste-based argument, for example, if an audience member does not find Graham LinehanÕs sneering at crossdressers, Noel FieldingÕs on-air sampling of a profiterole, or a hastily assembled confessional show about a recent ADHD diagnosis funny, it is not because these events are in fact not comedy, but because the comedic tastes of the spectator run perpendicular to the material presented.",1
"Under this broad and inclusive umbrella, anyone, from a pun-peddling uncle on Facebook to a racist screaming about immigrants from an open-mic stage, could theoretically be called a comedian through mere assertion.",1
"This, of course, is different than, say, an argument as to whether Steve Martin or Richard Pryor was the funnier comedian.",1
"Here, subjective tastes may very well allow for a dislike of MartinÕs absurdist methodology in favour of PryorÕs more vulgar storytelling approach or vice-versa.",1
"What is not in question, however, is whether Martin and Pryor were practicing comedy in the first place.",1
"As this essay will demonstrate, both these performers, along with others of their calibre, are successful as comedians because of their alignment with a core understanding of comedic first principles and not because of a flirtation with a presumably advantageous vocational identity.",1
"As with its industry trappings, to achieve the necessary foundational clarity for establishing a definitive aim of comedy, all subjective concerns regarding methodological approaches and audience tastes must likewise be subtracted from the argument to see what, if anything, remains at the core.",1
"Which is to ask: Is there such a thing as a universal and objective purpose to comedy and, if so, what are its principle attributes Ironically, however, it is precisely this exponentially growing distribution of the word ÒcomedyÓ as a vocational epithet and the concomitant industry that has grown up around the practice that belie the absurdism of believing there is no such thing as a universal comedic purpose.",1
"Asserting that anybody can do comedy is, after all, a parallel way of asserting that there is no such thing as comedy.",1
"For instance, if both a modern Fringe show with ÒADHDÓ in the title, structured entirely around weak narratives of self-diagnosis and incessant appeals to pity, and the irreverently insightful satire of Aristophanes are equally to be considered comedy, then there is nothing to be isolated from such a juxtaposition and evaluated as more or less true to the form.",1
There is no barometer by which one may judge how well a performer or writer hits the comedic mark if there is no mark at which to aim.,1
"Also, the empirical observation of so many non-comedians who have taken to calling themselves comedians, emboldened by the algorithmic free-for-all, demonstrates that there remains at least an appreciation and desire for the appellation, if not for the objective and universal purpose this label may once have signified.",1
"Subtracted from its purpose, however, the label is rendered meaningless.",1
"When artistic vocational titles, through a type of linguistic entropy, have become as malleably deconstructed and indiscriminately egalitarian as they are today, there is a concern that the time-honoured crafts those titles signify will be altered in tandem, facilitating not an evolutionary, but a devolutionary shift towards their social irrelevance and ultimate extinction.",1
The rampantly increasing ubiquity of these titles is nevertheless an effective catalyst by which true comedy aesthetes can be compelled to extricate themselves from the present cacophony to search for a fixed denotation of comedy at the origins of an historical continuum.,1
"From here, a lateral consensus among the ancients may prove vital in establishing a universal and objective comedic aim.",1
"Aristotle, in his Poetics, may have been first among the Western ancients to observe, with fittingly humorous irony, that because comedy was not Òat first treated seriouslyÓ its foundational principles are difficult to establish.",1
"At first glance, moreover, the diversity among the ancient comedic writers in terms of creative methodology seems somewhat consistent with contemporary taste-based arguments surrounding comedy.",1
"Some audiences, that is, may have preferred the humorous attacks of Aristophanes on the fickle trends and corrupt demagogues of his day whilst others may have discovered a malicious joy in the highly scatological and invective-fuelled poetry of the iambic writers Hipponax or Archilochus (authors whose satires were reputedly so effective they drove their shamed subjects to suicide).",1
"Nevertheless, the various technical approaches used among the ancients, as well as those adopted by contemporary performers, can be evaluated through the prism of what Aristotle characterises as the universal and objective purpose of comedy, which is that comedy must bring about happiness.",1
"Such happiness can be the sense of all being well with the world when the loose, chaotic strands of a Shakespearean comedy are tied up neatly at the end or it can be manifested as the joyful satisfaction of seeing exalted demagogues or corrupt institutions excoriated, as in the satires of Aristophanes, Swift, or Twain.",1
"Whatever the methodology employed, the purpose of eliciting the happiness to which not just the comedic antithesis of tragedy but also the regular quotidian stasis of human life does not reach remains a fixed objective for both true practitioners and true connoisseurs of the comedic art form.",1
"Defining comedy as a vehicle for happiness, though, and upholding the state of happiness as the epitome of personal and social good necessarily places Aristotle at odds with the earlier, decidedly anti-comedic, sentiments of Plato.",1
"Comedy, as Plato envisioned it, was a danger both to the self and society as it ran contrary to reason and, especially when effective enough to elicit a physical reaction in the form of violent laughter, threatened the order of the idealised State.",1
"Despite their stated variance on the issue, Aristotle and Plato are not in conflict when it comes to the inherent qualities of the expected comedic outcome.",1
"What chiefly emerges from this Platonic/Aristotelian dichotomy on the social effect of comedy, however, is not a debate on the nature of comedy, but a debate as to what constitutes happiness.",1
"Despite their stated variance on the issue, Aristotle and Plato are not in conflict when it comes to the inherent qualities of the expected comedic outcome.",1
"In fact, AristotleÕs own classification of comedy as the least mimetic of the original literary genres, which is to say least representative of the natural world, could be construed as a positive recapitulation of PlatoÕs negative conception of comedy as anathema to a reality-derived sense of reason.",1
"If the threats to reason, order, and the State so feared by Plato are the concave to the convex of AristotleÕs comedy-inspired happiness, then comedy, at least in terms of objective, remains fixed.",1
It is the understanding of happiness which remains malleable.,1
"Whereas Plato envisions happiness in a considerably less exuberant manner as the mild contentment of a well-reasoning individual contributing to and being shaped by a well-governed state, the very comedy that threatens this stasis is the source of the highest personal and social joy for Aristotle.",1
"While both viewpoints acknowledge the existence of a thing called comedy, only one is made happy by it.",1
"Syllogistically, the misery of the one entails the happiness of the other.",1
"To this effect, for true appreciators of the art form, like Aristotle, the happiness that is comedyÕs universal and objective purpose must de facto run contrary to the contentment of anti-comedy voices like PlatoÕs.",1
"A comedy that echoes distilled reason, seeks mimesis with order, and furthers the ends of a state would be a reductio ad absurdum, annihilating itself through assimilation with objectively anti-comedic aims.",1
This underscores the unfunny absurdism of GB News stalwart Andrew Doyle or ÒTriggernometryÓ podcast host Konstantin Kisin palming off Tory talking points as politically incorrect satire.,1
"Contrary to such dire examples as these, the happiness which comedy strives to elicit must be one which instead upends reason, order, and the presumed omnibenevolence of the State.",1
It is with this oppositional aim in mind that three distinct first principle attributes of the comedic purpose begin to crystallise.,1
"The first of these is that to contravene reason, order, and stasis, comedy must contain an element of surprise.",1
"When one groans at a well-known or obvious pun, stops a friend from repeating a joke heard before, or simply experiences the ennui of seeing yet another stand-up comic hopeful appearing before an exposed brick wall, it is because reason and order have been conditioned to anticipate an outcome and the disillusioned audiences in each of these instances, having been thwarted in their hopes for a comedic surprise, are forced in the end to settle for a reason and order that at least does not repeat itself.",1
"Their expectations remain unsurpassed and, as a result, rather than having their ordered state of being upended, it is in fact confirmed and reinforced.",1
"The possibility bears mentioning here as well that, with the passing of time, reason and order simply ossify within the collective mind as received wisdom or, more pejoratively, uncritical thinking.",1
"In this case, an effective comedian would be more indicative of true reason by using his or her creative abilities in a surprising manner to expose and upend a stagnant mental state of being that calls itself reason, but which is instead a quasi-instinctual pattern of rote behaviours and beliefs.",1
"To be sure, this foundational aspect of surprise is universal to other genres such as horror and science fiction, to name just a few, but its applicability to divergent fields only bolsters its necessity in comedy.",1
"As a purported horror that fails to surprise and cause fear should not be considered a horror, so, too, a purported comedy that fails to surprise and elicit happiness has failed at being a comedy.",1
"Furthermore, the absence of this first comedic attribute, as will be made clear, necessarily negates the presence of the other two.",1
"The comedic first principle of surprise, that is, must sequentially be met by the next principle, which is a violent reaction from the audience in the form of authentic laughter.",1
It is this aspect that effectively elevates comedy from mere shock value or murky convolution with other genres.,1
"A surprise that elicits a startled jolt and anticipatory fear or one that provokes communal outrage and self-righteous denunciations would be more suited to the genres, respectively, of suspense or political propaganda.",1
"The comedic surprise, on the other hand, must incite laughter, specifically that of a violent strain.",1
"To shed more expansive light on this comedic first principle of violence, a distinction must, of course, be drawn here between the authentic (or belly) laugh and the inauthentic (or head) laugh.",1
The belly laugh is the necessary physical corollary to the comedic first principle of surprise which Thomas Hobbes described best when he named it the ÒSudden GloryÉ the passion which maketh those grimaces called laughter.Ó ,1
"Following immediately in the wake of the comedically unexpected, this unleashing of violent laughter, inexplicably and uncontrollably, leaves audience members feeling as if an act had been perpetrated on them by an outside agent rather than that they had engaged in any premeditated behaviour of their own volition.",1
"One might consider here how the violent jargon of the modern comedic lexicon bears testimony to this first principle with expressions like Òhe killed the room last nightÓ or Òshe slayed the audience with her impressions.Ó Contrarily, the premeditation involved with the inauthentic (or head) laugh places it outside the remit of true comedy for not being contingent on any element of surprise invoked by an external comedic agent, but on the reasoned (or uncritically thinking) results of an interior monologue.",1
"A comedian that solicits this sort of non-violent, head-based laughter is not, objectively speaking, practicing comedy.",1
"Whether the aim is the alleviation of social anxiety, ingratiation within the ordered confines of received normality, or even the guilt-orchestrated manifestation of communal politeness in the presence of a struggling comedian, an inauthentic head laugh from an audience serves to uphold reason, order, and stasis and not upend them.",1
"Because of this, it is likely that such precogitated, unviolent laughter would be welcomed by Plato for its dual ability to uphold social order and simultaneously offer the aural facade of joy and freedom within that social order.",1
Something similar can be discerned when delineating the oft-overlooked differences between parody and satire.,1
"Hermann Gring, for example, was reportedly fond of light-hearted parodies concerning his external appearance and mannerisms once he apprehended that the resulting inauthentic head laughs could serve to humanise his image and, by extension, the Nazi state.",1
"On the other hand, any genuinely surprising satirical insight that provoked authentic and violent laughter at the expense of Gring or Nazism would have been rightly construed as a threat to the established order.",1
"However, it might also be surmised that Plato would detect a certain unreasonableness to the inauthentic head laugh as it entails laughing when there is no physical need for doing so.",1
"Despite equating the violence of authentic laughter with an overt threat to the State, as Plato does, its immediacy and uncontrollability would, at the very least, render it an excusable biological necessity.",1
"Nevertheless, his humourless admonition in The Republic that Òwhen one abandons himself to violent laughter his condition provokes a violent reactionÓ proves a fitting textual pivot by which to turn from the physical result of effective comedy to what is at once both PlatoÕs greatest concern and comedyÕs most insurrectionary first principle, which is, of course, subversion.",1
"Even if it can only be realised as an artistic wish or an idealised promise, comedic happiness, initiated through surprise and propelled by laughter, must constitute an act of subversion.",1
"Even if it can only be realised as an artistic wish or an idealised promise, comedic happiness, initiated through surprise and propelled by laughter, must constitute an act of subversion.",1
"Although the methodological approaches, idiomatic motifs, choices of medium, and topical ranges may vary wildly between comedic writers, the universal can nonetheless be deduced from the particulars.",1
"If the happiness that is the objective aim of a true comedy aesthete is to run perpendicular to received notions of reason, order, and the state, it must by nature be subversive to those governing shibboleths.",1
"Whether, on one end of the spectrum, an Horatian comedy of manners exposes and ridicules the arbitrary nature of received social mores or, on the other, a scathing Juvenalian satire uses highly literate invective to lead an esteemed public figure into ignominious shame, an act of subversion is evidenced in both instances.",1
"In each, a stasis is upended, although the methodologies and topical scopes differ.",1
"In fact, AristotleÕs classification of comedy as the genre least mimetic of reality (as opposed to tragedy, the most mimetic) encompasses the possibility that comedy could even be an act of subversion against a pre-existing tragic state of the human condition in which happiness itself becomes an insurrectionary force against the nightmare of being.",1
"It should be mentioned here, by way of caveat, that although the subversive label still very much appeals to more than a few of todayÕs self-professed satirists, many of these would happily do without the associated blacklisting and other punitive measures historically suffered by true comedy subversives, from Molire to Lenny Bruce.",1
"One of the better examples of faux subversion in recent times is the Netflix Special template in which high-salaried figures such as Matt Rife, Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais, or Jimmy Carr will deliver a few unimaginatively banal one-liners about domestic abuse, transgenderism, or even HitlerÕs extermination of the gypsies.",1
"With like predictability, social media soon responds with a chorus of condemnation, often spearheaded by lifetime comedy careerists such as Janus-faced Frankie Boyle.",1
"Meanwhile, as one side feigns sincerity and the other persecution, the end result is that two ordered states of being are upheld and reinforced Ð the stultifying technocratic lifestyle of social media and the ham-fisted business model of Netflix.",1
"In fact, the only ones to lose out in this orchestrated scenario are fans of genuinely subversive comedy.",1
"As with the element of surprise, the element of subversion is also not specific to the comedic genre.",1
"While surprise can take various non-comedic forms, so, too, and more often, can subversion.",1
"Isolated from the first two aspects of surprise and violent laughter, subversion on its own might be the domain of political dissidents and conscientious objectors just as surprise on its own might be the domain of horror or suspense authors.",1
"Violent laughter, meanwhile, when not serving as the physical linchpin uniting the two other comedic elements of surprise and subversion, would be altogether something different, and perhaps disturbing, on its own.",1
"The desired result of comedy to provide happiness to true enthusiasts of the art entails the commingling and interplay of all three of these first principles, surprise, violent laughter, and subversion, in a triune manner.",1
Each is dependent on the other for its actualisation in the comedic scheme both as an important particular on its own merits and as an instrumental component in bringing forth happiness to a truly comedy-savvy audience.,1
"Employing the semiotics of the trinity here, one could envision the element of surprise as the inspired parent who sires the revolutionary offspring of violence in order that the divine spirit of subversion may descend upon a comedic event, converting audiences in the process to untrammelled comedic bliss.",1
"Jettisoning from the contemporary comedic milieu the deceptive industry trappings of mainstream name recognition, engineered internet clamour, or even the do-it-yourself blueprint of hosting comedy nights as self-esteem exercises, is there anything emblematic of this triune operation of the first principles of surprise, violence, and subversion discernible at the core?",1
Quite the contrary.,1
"There is as little surprise, for example, in ostensibly free speech-supporting comedians complaining about what they call ÒwokeÓ students as there is in their ostensibly politically correct counterparts dwelling sanctimoniously on race, gender, or sexual orientation.",1
A cutaway to a one-liner delivered from a smirking guest comedian on a reality television cooking show is as unlikely to elicit a violent belly laugh as a relative sharing a collection of Christmas cracker puns on Facebook.,1
"Moreover, it would be an undisputed rarity if anything representative of authentic comedic subversion were to appear on a tax-funded and government-facilitated network like the BBC, much less in the Lord of the Flies atmosphere of the internet, where anyone possessing the social media conch shell can herald themselves, with no small flourish of artificially generated digital fanfare, a reigning Monarch of Comedy.",1
"This is not to deny the possibility, of course, that the above pursuits cannot likewise have as their chief aim the dispensation of happiness.",1
"Again, as seen in the Platonic/Aristotelian dichotomy concerning the role of comedy in relation to society and the self, it is not the comedic purpose that is malleable, but the nature of happiness.",1
Perhaps it is true that some modern audiences are seeking out a new form of happiness through attending public mental health confessionals marketed as stand-up comedy or through gorging on the rambling social media output of the latest comedian-turned-political-pundit opining humourlessly on inconsequential issues of the day.,1
"However, even if one were to concede that some form of happiness is achievable via these pastimes, in spite or possibly because of this emotion being tempered with maudlin pity and faux outrage, neither the Aristotelian nor the Platonic view would hold such happiness to be the result of comedy.",1
"Rather than destroying the art of comedy with his anti-comedic assessment, Plato inadvertently supplies the very template by which one can apprehend comedyÕs universal aim and insurrectionary first principles.",1
"As a final word, it would be remiss for a true comedy aesthete not to express some gratitude to Plato for at least demonstrating enough conviction to flatly dismiss comedy outright instead of colonising it and conforming it to his own contemptuous view of humour.",1
"As we have seen, rather than destroying the art of comedy with his anti-comedic assessment, Plato inadvertently supplies the very template by which one can apprehend comedyÕs universal aim and insurrectionary first principles.",1
"A subtler and far more effective approach at hastening comedyÕs extinction is the infestation of pretenders to the profession, bringing to mind an earlier critique of another creative field in which the visionary William Blake once wrote of establishment painter Sir Joshua Reynolds, ÒThis man was hired to depress art.Ó Contemplating the current industry elevation of algorithmic recognition and jaded opportunism over natural talent and artistic inspiration, it can at times appear as if contemporary comedians are being hired precisely for the joyless purpose of depressing comedy.",1
Will Franken is a solo sketch comedian and Juvenalian satirist with over twenty yearsÕ experience writing and performing for audiences in America and Europe.,1
"His work has been reviewed in various publications, including The New York Times, The San Francisco Chronicle, The Guardian, The Independent, and The Sunday Times.",1
"For his 2014 show The Stuff They Put in Sleep, Franken was awarded both the Three Weeks EditorsÕ Award and the inaugural Barry Award for Best Performer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.",1
"In 2017, he was the recipient of the annual Tithe Grant Award from the William Blake Society and from Spring 2020 to early 2021, he produced, directed, and starred in an unexpurgated audiobook of John MiltonÕs Paradise Lost.",1
"He holds a BA in Philosophy and an MA in British Literature from Southwest Missouri State University, where for a time he was also an instructor.",1
Franken is currently working on a book exploring the philosophy of ethics in classic cinema.,1
"We compared the mechanical properties (burst pressure) of our electrospun scaffolds with the autologous grafts, which are todayÕs gold standard for vascular bypass surgeries.",1
"[55] And found the burst pressure range of the great saphenous vein was 1680Ð3900 mmHg, [56]and that of the internal mammary artery was 2000Ð3196 mmHg.",1
"[56,57] According to Konig et al., a minimum burst pressure for TEVG was 1700 mmHg.",1
[57] We could therefore conclude that our artificial blood vessels have suitable mechanical properties and biological properties to serve as a vascular graft.,1
Polycaprolactone (PCL); polylactic acid (PLA); NA stands for missing in the original source; # indicates no value.,1
The first and second rows of the table represent the control group (group A) and the experimental group (group B) in the experiment.,1
"The experimental results confirmed that with the increase of gelatin content, both the maximum stress and elongation would decrease.",1
"Moreover, it can be found that although the core velocity remains unchanged, the acceleration of the shell injection velocity will squeeze the core space and make the diameter of the core fiber smaller.",1
"This effect was the least in group 0.11, and greater in groups 0.25 and 0.35.",1
"Different from our initial expectation, a certain core PU injection speed can provide a stable PU fiber diameter to ensure the mechanical properties of blood vessels.",1
This new finding has not been reported in previous studies.,1
"To validate this point, a series of mechanical analyses were performed.",1
The results showed that both the vascular maximum stress and elongation decreased with the increase of gelatin injection velocity at the same core layer injection velocity.,1
The transmission electron microscopy of the four groups of fibers provided intuitive evidence.,1
Coomassian bright blue staining confirmed from a macroscopic perspective that there was no protein component in the vascular membrane of the PU group.,1
"With the increase of gelatin content in the coaxial group, the blue color deepened, which indirectly confirmed the existence and increased of gelatin.",1
"The results of quantitative analysis of gelatin Coomassie bright blue staining are as follows:0 mg/g (PU group), 26.57 mg/g (0.11 group), 41.36 mg/g (0.25 group), 68.85 mg/g (0.35 group), the increase of gelatin content in the four groups of vascular membranes was also confirmed.",1
Masson staining was performed for the selected optimal proportion group (group 0.11).,1
"The results also revealed that the ring, elliptical, or double-track blue-dyed gelatin components were distributed in the pipe wall, which confirmed the existence of coaxial gelatin components from the microscopic perspective.",1
Rapid cell infiltration of the grafts is the first and crucial step for vascular remodeling.,1
"[58] In the embedding [35] studies overlap with the topics found in the present study.experiment, the cell number in the vascular wall of the coaxial group was significantly higher than that of the non-coaxial group at all time points(p < 0.001).",1
The experimental results show that coaxial group vascular membrane was more conducive to cell entry and the remodeling.,1
"This result is consistent with our design philosophy, that is, the gelatin degradation in the shell provides space for the cells to entry.",1
There are still some limitations in our experiment.,1
"First, electrospinning does not guarantee every fiber in the tube wall a coaxial fiber.",1
"Secondly, no group with a lower proportion than group 0.11 was designed and the shell velocity of the new group should be between 0.68 and 0.11 for experiments, which may have better mechanical properties, and the thickness of shell layer will be sacrificed.",1
"In addition, subcutaneous embedding experiment results are insufficient.",1
HE staining was used to estimate the number of nuclei.,1
Immunohistochemical staining and qualitative analysis should have been performed in the next step to determine the type of cells in the membrane.,1
"Last but not least, no animal experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vascular transplantation in vivo, which is necessary before clinical application.",1
The next step in our research will address these limitations.,1
"In this study, four groups of PU/Gel scaffold with core/ shell fiber structure were successfully prepared via coaxial electrospinning.",1
"EDC-NHS crosslinking was found to be able to increase vascular stress, elastic modulus, and reduce elongation.",1
The increase of the injection velocity of gelatin reduced the diameter of the core fiber.,1
Gelatin was found to decrease vascular maximum stress and elongation.,1
Burst pressure of 0.11group reached the maximum (2844.55 ± 272.65 mmHg) after cross-linking.,1
"The cytotoxicity and embedding experiment further indicated that the scaffold samples had good biocompatibility and cell affinity, allowing the infiltration of cells into its interior.",1
The PU/Gel scaffold with core/shell fiber structure prepared via coaxial electrospinning was thus proved to have a promising application in vascular tissue engineering.,1
"Although research in general medicine is diverse, it has not been compared with research in a different medical specialty.",1
"The study aim was to understand the characteristics of research produced at Japanese university departments of general medicine and published in English-language journals, via comparison with another academic specialty, cardiology.",1
"In this cross-sectional study, a nationwide survey of the official websites of 82 university-affiliated medical schools in Japan was conducted in April 2020 to identify the heads of general medicine departments.",1
We then surveyed the research output of these individuals in terms of original article output and research field diversity for journals listed in the Web of Science Core Collection of journals from 2010 to 2019.,1
A similar survey of cardiology department publications was also conducted to provide a reference for intergroup comparisons and analysis of covariance.,1
The analysis included 128 researchers from 78 general medicine departments and 96 researchers from 81 cardiology departments.,1
The dominant research field of general medicine was general and internal medicine; that of cardiology was cardiac/cardiovascular systems.,1
"Data stratification by research field showed that general medicine researchers published significantly more articles than researchers in cardiology, a field that contains relatively few researchers.",1
"Furthermore, a comparison of individual researchers with the same number of published articles showed that researchers in general medicine departments published across a significantly wider range of fields than those in cardiology.",1
This is the first study to describe the research characteristics of general medicine university departments in Japan through comparison with research in a different academic specialty.,1
General medicine researchers in Japan comprise a heterogeneous group that mainly publishes research on general and internal medicine.,1
Some general medicine researchers take a multidisciplinary approach to research and publishing.,1
"The production of scientific research is essential for the development of general medicine as an academic discipline.[1] The importance of research has frequently been discussed in the related fields of general practice, primary care, family medicine, and general internal medicine (GIM).[2-6] The diversity of research in general medicine is well documented.",1
"This research field includes topics such as quality of care, universal health coverage, patient complexity, and personality in patient care, and covers a broad spectrum of individuals, families, and communities.[4-7] These international research trends also exist in Japan.[8-10] Publication trends in English-language academic papers in medical science have been widely studied using bibliometric analysis of databases such as Web of Science (WOS), Google Scholar, and Scopus.[11,12] The production of academic papers in the field of general medicine has been actively investigated.",1
"International comparisons of publication trends in general medicine and related fields in North America, Europe, and Australia were conducted in 2011 and 2019.[13,14] Some reports have described the diversity of general medicine research as indicative of the multidisciplinary nature of research fields in publishing and the classification of organ systems.[15-17] These characteristics have informed research on publishing trends in individual countries and regions, including Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and the USA.[16-20] Although there have been several attempts to understand the characteristics of related fields in general medicine compared with other disciplines, such comparisons have not focused on the diversity of the general medicine research field.[21,22] In recent years, several studies have examined the production of scientific research in general medicine departments in Japan.[23-25] For example, Watari et al[23] used an online questionnaire survey to explore research areas investigated by general medicine department heads in university hospitals in Japan.",1
"However, previous studies have focused on a single specialty; no studies have compared the characteristics of general medicine research in Japan with that of other specialties.",1
"In Japan, the first university department of general medicine was established in 1981 at Kawasaki Medical School.[26] Additional medical schools across the country have since been established.",1
"As of 2017, approximately 80% of university hospitals had departments related to general medicine,[27] but it was not until 2018 that a third-party accreditation system for medical specialists was initiated in Japan.[28] University departments related to general medicine in Japan include family medicine, GIM, primary care medicine, and community medicine.[27] Both academically and clinically, cardiology is one of the most influential disciplines worldwide and cardiology research has been explored using bibliometric analysis.[29] According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, cardiologists comprise the largest group of organ-specific physicians in Japan.[30] Whereas cardiology research is characterized by organ-specific specialization limited to the cardiovascular field, general medicine encompasses cross-disciplinary fields and a wide range of diseases.",1
"Therefore, cardiology research output provides a useful contrast to general medicine research, and permits an examination of the characteristic research profiles of the 2 disciplines.",1
"The study aims were to characterize the research from university departments of general medicine in Japan by analyzing the output and range of original articles published in English, and to compare this research with that of another academic specialty, cardiology.",1
"This is the first study to demonstrate the research output of physicians in charge of general medicine university departments in Japan who have published in English-language journals, compared with department heads in another specialty.",1
"A total of 128 researchers from 78 general medicine departments, and 96 researchers from 81 cardiology departments, were included in the study.",1
We found that general medicine practitioners in Japan publish more multidisciplinary research than do researchers in cardiology and related departments.,1
We suggest 2 possible reasons for this difference: researchers in general medicine departments in Japan may represent a heterogeneous group that publishes articles in different fields; and there may be a tendency for individual researchers in this group to publish in a relatively multidisciplinary manner.,1
"Although there is an international trend for general medicine research to encompass numerous fields, the output from individual countries indicates their emphasis on specific areas.",1
"Studies of research in general medicine in recent decades have variously identified the top research categories as psychiatry and cardiology in Germany,[16] circulatory and respiratory systems in the Netherlands,[18] and medicine (general/internal) and public/environmental/occupational health in both Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.[19,20] Taking a different approach, Gehanno et al[37] assessed the variety of specialties covered by the top 4 general medical journals (The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, and British Medical Journal) and found that the top 3 fields were cardiology, neurology, and environmental/public health.",1
"Similarly, our study identified cardiac and cardiovascular systems as an active publishing field in general medicine for authors from Japan, but GIM was the predominant field.",1
"Interestingly, Watari et al[23] suggested that the 3 most common research themes in general medicine in Japan are GIM, medical management, and infectious disease medicine.",1
"Although we also found that GIM was the dominant research area, the second and third most common research areas differed between our study and that of Watari et al.[23] This may reflect differences in research methods (i.e., use of a questionnaire survey compared with bibliometric research) and classification (i.e., used of national grant categories compared with WOS categories).",1
The heterogeneous range of research by general medicine practitioners in Japan may reflect a cultural influence.,1
"In Japan, even physicians who are trained as specialists are often expected to serve their community as a generalist or traditional family doctor.[38] Publications in cardiology, gastroenterology, and endocrinology were in the top 10 specialties of organ-specific internal medicine from the general medicine university departments in this study.",1
"According to a 2018 national survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the 2 largest groups of specialists in Japan are cardiologists (12,865 physicians) and gastroenterologists (19,054 physicians), and there are more certified endocrinologists (2,180 physicians) than certified family physicians.[30] The number of family physicians board certified by the Japan Primary Care Association (JPCA), a leading academic general medicine organization in Japan, was only 673 as of 2017.[39,40] This imbalance suggests that researchers trained in organ-specific specialties are sometimes affiliated with a general medicine department because of cultural attitudes toward the practice of general medicine in Japan.",1
"The tendency of individual researchers to publish in a relatively multidisciplinary manner may be related to the diversity of the clinical practice of general medicine, which inherently provides a broad spectrum of health care.[15-20] In Japan, the contributions of university and hospital departments of general medicine to the literature on treatment of unknown fevers and diagnostics indicate a high affinity for multiorgan treatment.[41] Hospitalist practice, which is derived from the practice of GIM in the USA, is characterized by its relevance to organ-specific internal medicine and geriatric medicine.[42,43] However, our study showed that researchers in general medicine produced significantly fewer articles than their counterparts in cardiology, possibly because physicians working in the university hospital setting are expected to focus more on clinical practice than on publishing activities.[43,44] Hospitalists in Japan may feel a duty to contribute to non-research fields, such as clinical education and promotion of the establishment of general medicine as a specialty.[28,40,44] Our finding indicating the lack of a dominant field in general medicine highlights another problem: only 0.7% of all publications were in primary health care, which should be a core research area for any university-affiliated department of general medicine.",1
"Carratal-Munuera et al[45] found that articles from the primary health care field comprised only 0.73% of total academic publications worldwide, and they did not limit author affiliation to the primary health care field.",1
"In a study that limited author affiliation to departments/institutes of family medicine, Lin et al[19] found that 20.7% of all academic publications in the USA and 23.0% in Canada were in the primary health care category; in Taiwan, this figure was only 0.4%.",1
"In Japan, Aoki et al[46] reported that the proportion of domestically originated articles in the primary care field in major international journals was 0.15%.",1
"Komagamine et al[47] found that only 3.8% of conference presentations in JPCA annual meetings were eventually published as original articles, in contrast to a publication rate of >40% for presenters at annual conferences in other countries.",1
These international comparisons of scientific output strongly suggest that much progress needs to be made in primary care-related research in Japan.,1
"However, the low number of primary health care articles identified in this study may have been influenced by the paucity of primary care journals in the WOSCC.",1
"The top 5 fields in both general medicine and cardiology in this study were represented by 165 journals in general and internal medicine, 138 in cardiac and cardiovascular systems, 65 in peripheral vascular disease, 143 in endocrinology and metabolism, 270 in pharmacology and pharmacy, and only 19 in primary health care (Journal Citation Reports; September 2020).[48] The Journal of General and Family Medicine, an official English-language journal of the JPCA, is included in the WOSCC as part of the Emerging Sources Citation Index, but is listed under the categories of general and internal medicine and not primary health care (Master Journal List search: September 22, 2020).[49] Therefore, the productivity of academic research in the primary care field in Japan may appear lower than it actually is owing to the classification of journals in the WOSCC.",1
"Overall, the international trends in academic publishing suggest that the output of general medicine papers by Japanese researchers, either collectively or individually, lags behind that of other countries, slowing the maturity of general medicine as an academic discipline in Japan.",1
"According to Glanville et al,[13] the total number of primary care articles indexed in MEDLINE and Embase from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA combined was 82,169 from 2001 to 2007.",1
"The number of articles by country ranged from 4,020 in Germany to 42,643 in the USA.",1
"Without adjustment for the number of researchers, language of publication, research funding, population of each country, and study design, such comparisons are limited.",1
"However, the present study showed that the number of primary care articles from Japan over 10 years (2,923) was relatively low.",1
"However, comparatively poor research productivity in general medicine is also a challenge in other countries.",1
"Some reasons for this paucity that have been highlighted are incompatibility with educational practices in undergraduate and postgraduate settings, unstructured research networks, and lack of research funding[50-53]; the situation is similar in Japan.[46,54] Further exploration of JapanÕs unique barriers to research activity, and a more direct comparison of academic publishing productivity between Japan and other countries, are needed.",1
The articles examined in this study do not necessarily represent the entire research output of any individual researcher.,1
"First, we did not examine Japanese-language articles.",1
"Second, we only included publications classified as original research articles in the WOSCC.",1
"Third, classification of articles by field of study using a single database (WOS) was used for practical reasons.",1
The WOS categories were created by Clarivate Analytics as a convenient classification system for internal usage.[35] This system provides a surrogate model that may not fully reflect reality.,1
"Thus, the single use of WOS may be inappropriate to determine publication category.",1
"Combining WOS with other databases would have enabled us to conduct a more comprehensive search of publications in different academic fields.[32] Alternatively, it may have been useful to create our own categories that reflected the study focus and to examine these in future studies.",1
There are also several limitations to our methods.,1
"First, staff numbers may influence departmental research output.[24,55] Although an examination of staff numbers was beyond the scope of this study, general medicine departments may contain fewer researchers than cardiology departments if the number of specialists is taken into account.[30,39] Thus, the simple comparisons of article numbers for researchers shown in Table 1 require careful interpretation.",1
"However, taking into account the proportion of articles by research field could offset the effect of staff numbers (Fig. 2).",1
"Even taking into account differences in staff numbers between the 2 specialties, the general medicine field seems to be a heterogeneous group (Fig. 3) that contains researchers who conduct multidisciplinary research (Fig. 4).",1
"Second, it is very likely that the search results contained some overlap between articles, particularly for studies involving collaborations between authors.",1
"However, a detailed crosscheck of author names to avoid such overlap was beyond the scope of this research.",1
"Third, this survey only targeted the person of highest authority in each relevant university department, thereby excluding other researchers in the same departments, as well as those working in non-university research institutes.",1
"There were 2 reasons why it was impractical to expand the study population: it would have resulted in duplication of published articles by researchers working together in the same department; and the inclusion of less experienced individuals (i.e., a research career of < 10 years) would have introduced bias for lower publication rate.",1
"Previous studies have focused on the research output of the person of highest authority; for example, 1 study investigated the research of pharmacy school deans in the USA.[56] Fourth, our survey included researchers who met the study criteria as of January 1, 2020, and English-language articles that appeared in the WOS up to April 2020, creating a gap of approximately 3 months.",1
"In Japan, organizational and faculty changes typically happen in April, which is the first month of the academic year; however, such changes may not immediately be reflected on the official website of each university.",1
"Therefore, it is possible that some researchers were removed from their posts between January and April 2020.",1
"However, it is unlikely that this would have substantially affected the overall results, as there has been no unified national reorganization of university researchers.",1
"The English-language articles produced by the heads of university departments of general medicine in Japan covered many fields, with most in GIM and few in primary care.",1
"The surveyed researchers were a heterogeneous group with a variety of research fields, and included individuals with a relatively multidisciplinary body of research.",1
"This study is important in that it identifies previously unknown publishing behaviors and research characteristics of researchers in university-affiliated general medicine departments in Japan, and compares such characteristics with those of researchers in cardiology departments.",1
Two researchers (FH and AVA) independently examined the full text of the remaining selected papers for extracting data.,1
All the data related to marine medicine that could be used in the main and sub topics of the marine medicine course were extracted.,1
Any ambiguities or disagreements between the evaluators were resolved through discussion and consensus by a third person.,1
"At this stage, a qualitative content analysis research method was conducted.",1
"Qualitative content analysis is the analysis of the content of narrative data, and it is a flexible method to identify prominent subthemes and patterns among themes.",1
"In the conditions of lack of enough knowledge about a phenomenon (such as marine medicine) or knowledge fragmentation, the inductive approach is recommended [11] to explain and interpret the data and elaborate the dominant and major themes of participantsÕ experiences [12].",1
The study participants consisted of experts and those who have experience and knowledge about marine medicine.,1
The participants were recruited in the study using a purposeful sampling method.,1
"Also, maximum variation in sampling was considered in terms of age, working experience, degree and working field.",1
"Inclusion criteria were having experience in marine medicine, having a master's degree or doctorate in the field of medical sciences, the ability to express experiences and desire to participate in the study.",1
The exclusion criterion was the unwillingness to continue the study.,1
Sampling continued until data saturation was reached.,1
Semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data.,1
"The research setting was the workplace of the participants, which the participants chose based on their preference and the researcher tried to help the participants express their experiences of marine medicine easily and freely by visiting at the chosen time of the participants and creating a safe environment and gaining their trust.",1
The researcher obtained written informed consent from the patients before the interviews.,1
The research questions were extracted by the discussion of the research team.,1
"The questions were open ended, neutral, clear, and relevant to the objective of the study.",1
"Four members of research team were working in the field of marine medicine which ensured the relevance of the interview questions to the research question and six members of the research team had the experience of conducting previous research interviews, which ensured the accuracy of the questions..",1
The Interview started with an grand tour question: what is marine medicine?,1
"Based on the answers, the interviews continued with probing and follow-up questions.",1
"All nonverbal behaviors, facial expressions and eye contact were paid attention during the interview.",1
The duration of the interviews was between 43Ð72 min and an average of 56 min based on the physical and psychological conditions of the participants and the quality of their responses to the questions.,1
All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.,1
The information obtained from the interviews was analyzed by conventional content analysis with Geranheim's method.,1
This method includes the following steps: 1-Writing down the interviews 2-Choosing the unit of analysis 3- Getting a general view of the entire interview by reading the units of analysis 4- Reading word by word and line by line and coding each meaningful unit (obtaining primary codes) of related concepts 5- Placing similar codes in a subcategory by constantly comparing codes.,1
6- Collecting similar subcategories in a category and naming them [13].,1
"In this study, Guba and Lincoln's criteria were used to increase trustworthiness, which are known as the gold standard.",1
"For this purpose, long-term involvement with the data and spending enough time to collect and analyze the data were used.",1
"Also, all the interviews were conducted under the supervision of the supervisor, and during the data analysis, the codes and categories that emerged were presented to the supervisors and advisors to review the cases and present and apply their revisions.",1
"To increase reliability, all documents and evidence related to the data were securely stored to help readers and external observers to trust the data.",1
"Also, a number of coded interviews along with the extracted categories were given to other researchers familiar with qualitative research methods to check the accuracy of coding and classification.",1
"In order to increase transferability, the researcher tried to provide in-depth and rich descriptions of the research context and word-for-word quotes of the participants in order to increase the fit of the theory with the context under study.",1
"The found topics in the literature review and content analysis of interviews were combined and formed the initial draft of the marine medicine syllabus, which was validated with the Delphi method in the next phase.",1
"In the third phase, a Delphi method was used to obtain the consensus of experts in the syllabus of marine medicine.",1
"Delphi is a valid and scientific method to provide comprehensive and reliable information about a controversial issue or to reach a consensus on an issue, which is done through quantitative and qualitative processes [14].",1
The purpose of this method is to make an expert judgment about a question.,1
"This method is based on the assumption that a group of experts with different attitudes create more valid results than the judgment of one person, even if he is the best in his field [15].",1
One of the applications of the Delphi method in health care is in the field of education and curriculum development [16].,1
"The Delphi method requires at least two rounds, and if the first round is open-ended, the required number of rounds is three [16].",1
"In this research, the initial draft of the marine medicine syllabus was compiled in the previous phases, and there was no need to do the first round, therefore, this study was conducted in two rounds.",1
"The Delphi panel consisted of 18 experts from health system policy makers, managers, university educators, health care providers and researchers who were well informed and experienced in the field of the marine medicine.",1
"Inclusion criteria were having at least five years work experience in marine medicine field, having a master's degree or doctorate in the field of medical sciences and desire to participate in the study.",1
The exclusion criterion was not completing the questionnaire and unwillingness to continue the study.,1
The main goal of the Delphi method is to reach a consensus [17].,1
Consensus should be determined before starting Delphi [18].,1
"The most common method of reporting consensus is the percentage of agreement, which is defined as a proportion of participants who agree with a certain rating range [19].",1
The consensus is not fixed [20] and has been determined from 51 to 100% in different studies [21].,1
"Like many studies [22Ð28], we also considered the cut-off point of 80% agreement as reaching consensus, and the main and sub topics that after each round of Delphi, by less than 80% of experts obtain very agree or agree, were removed from the syllabus.",1
"At first, the researchers contacted the experts and obtained their consent to participate in the study.",1
Then the Delphi questionnaire was sent to them.,1
"The Delphi questionnaire was structured from concepts found from previous phases for a rating on a 5-point Likert scale (1-strongly disagree, 2-disagree, 3-neutral, 4-agree, 5-strongly agree).",1
The face validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by faculty members.,1
Interrater reliability between panelists in first round was estimated based on the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and 0.944 CronbachÕs alpha indicated an excellent interrater agreement.,1
Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a standard tool to determine the interrater reliability of more than two raters based on interval scaled data [29].,1
The five-point rating scale used in this study is interval-scaled.,1
Interrater reliability between panelists in the second round was estimated based on the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and 0.810 CronbachÕs alpha indicated a good interrater agreement.,1
"After the completion of the first round of Delphi, items that had less than 80% consensus between the panelists were removed from the syllabus and topics suggested by the experts were added to the list for judging in the second round.",1
"In the second round of Delphi, topics that achieved 80% or above consensus and suggested topics consisted of the second-round questionnaire and was given to the expert panel.",1
"After the completion of the second round, the items that had less than 80% consensus among the participants were removed and the remaining topics formed the final syllabus of the marine medicine.",1
"Findings from the literature review were categorized into three main categories including the therapeutic benefits of the sea category consisted of thalassotherapy and sea therapeutic products subcategories, diseases and health problems caused by the marine environment category consisted of diseases and health problems caused by marine creatures, diseases and health problems caused by diving and disease and health problems caused by marine toxins and pollution subcategories, and diseases and health problems caused by maritime occupation category consisted of diseases and health problems related to safety, diseases and health problems related to physical health and diseases and health problems related to mental health subcategories.",1
"In this study, 12 experts in the marine medicine field were interviewed.",1
"They had 38Ð67 years old, 7Ð46 years of work experience, master's or doctoral degrees, and were working in the cities of Tehran, Shiraz, Bandar Abbas and Bushehr of Iran.",1
"The participants were policymakers of the health system, managers, university educators, health care providers and researchers who had knowledge and experience in marine medicine fields.",1

"The panel experts had 38 to 60 years, 11 to 40 years of work experience, master's or doctorate degrees in Tehran, Shiraz, Bushehr and Bandar Abbas cities of Iran.",1
Table 2 shows the demographic information of the Delphi expert panel.,1
The main and sub topics extracted in the literature review and content analysis were combined and formed the first round Delphi questionnaire.,1
"This topics include overview of marine medicine, therapeutic uses of the sea, health at sea, common physical diseases and injuries at sea, diving and hyperbaric, emergency at sea and psychology at sea.",1
"After the first round the therapeutic uses of the sea main topic obtains 22.3%, thalassotherapy sub topic obtains 22.3%, sea therapeutic products sub topic obtains 33.5%, importance of health at sea sub topic obtains 66.7% and importance of psychology at sea sub topic obtains 55.7% of consensus and removed from syllabus list.",1
"Also, some topics were suggested by experts at this round that added to the list of topics.",1
"In the second round, one of the experts donÕt complete the questionnaire and this round was conducted with 17 expert panels.",1
Delphi second round questionnaire main topics were similar to the first round except the therapeutic uses of the sea main topic was removed..,1
"After the second round, only the maritime convention subtopic been removed from the syllabus because of obtained 64.7% consensus and other main topics and subtopics obtained above 80% consensus and were confirmed.",1
Percents of consensus of the Delphi expert panel in rounds 1 and 2 are shown in Table 3.,1
The topics extracted in each phase are shown in Table 4.,1
"At first, it is necessary for all students to get a general picture of marine medicine and the differences and similarities of this field with general medicine.",1
"This main topic includes introduction to the seas and coasts of Iran, introduction to the marine medicine, introduction to marine rescue organizations and international health rules and regulations in the marine domain.",1
Treatment of diseases at sea is very challenging.,1
"Therefore, we must use all necessary measures and facilities to prevent diseases and injuries in the sea.",1
"Therefore, health at sea is very important and should be given a lot of attention.",1
"The aim of health at sea is the improving and providing the highest possible level of physical, mental and social health for persons at sea.",1
"This main topic includes personal health, food health, sleep health, sea travel health, environmental health and occupational health at sea.",1
The most important main topic in the marine medicine course is to acquaint the students with common diseases and physical injuries at sea.,1
"Some of these diseases are not seen on land and others are common between land and sea, but treatment in sea is challenging due to the special limitations of the sea.",1
Students should be well aware of how to manage and treat these diseases.,1
"This main topic includes diseases specific to the sea, diseases and injuries caused by dangerous sea creatures, diseases and injuries caused by marine toxins, diseases and injuries caused by marine occupation, injuries and damages caused by naval combat, infectious and tropical diseases.",1

"This main topic includes familiarity with the floating infirmary, medicine and medical equipment standards in sea missions, nursing and triage and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in water.",1
Special conditions of the sea provide a basis for the occurrence of mental disorders in people.,1
"The people in the sea are isolated and everything they see is water and there is no land around them, and this causes anxiety and depression.",1
The root of anxiety is the lack of control over the situation and floating vehicles are moving very fast and so the feeling of mastery at sea is very low and the stress hormones level in the sea is much higher than normal that cause several psychological problems.,1
"This main topic includes depression, anxiety, addiction, factitious disorder, burnout, suicide and psychological, social and cognitive problems of the families of the naval personnel.",1
"Disease and injuries at sea can be very troublesome, and one of the ways to prevent them is to select the proper persons to work at sea, which is done through medical examinations.",1
"The aim of the medical examination is to ensure that the seafarer being examined is medically fit to perform his or her routine and emergency duties at sea and is not suffering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by service at sea, to render him or her unfit for service or to endanger the health of other persons on board.",1
"This main topic includes pre-employment medical examinations of people for working at sea, periodic medical examinations of people working at sea and diving license examinations.",1

Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis known as the ÒKing of Diseases or KingÕÕs Disease.Ó It results from a long-term purine metabolism disorder that causes an elevation in uric acid level and deposition of urate crystals around the joints.,1
"The disease is most common in adult males, with a male-to-female ratio of 10:1, and its incidence and prevalence are on the rise.[1] It typically presents with local redness, swelling, heat, and pain in the joints and usually occurs in the first metatarsophalangeal joint.",1
"Arthrocentesis targeted at finding specific urate crystals is the gold standard for the diagnosis of gout.[2] Currently, the treatment options in modern medicine are mostly western medicine-based for the treatment of a single target.",1
"Drugs, such as ebuxostat, benzbromarone, and allopurinol, reduce uric acid level.",1
"Other drugs, such as colchicine, glucocorticoids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, reduce inflammation.",1
"Analgesic and symptomatic treatment options are accompanied by certain adverse reactions, such as gastrointestinal reactions and liver and kidney function damage.",1
"Moreover, they have single therapeutic targets and are associated with easy relapse after drug withdrawal.[3Ð5] Therefore, the search for drugs with fewer side effects is a current research focus.",1
"In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gradually been acknowledged to have advantages in the treatment of gout.",1
"Research in this area is also deepening, but its therapeutic mechanism needs to be further verified.",1
Gout is categorized as ÒarthralgiaÓ and Òjoint-running windÓ in TCM.,1
"This disease is mostly caused by the patientÕs yang exuberance, damp-heat brewing internally, plus feeling of exogenous pathogens, damp heat stasis toxin blocking joints, and poor qi and blood.",1

"Gout is more of an autoinflammatory disease than a purely metabolic disease.[19] It is caused by hyperuricemia or persistently elevated serum uric acid levels that promote the deposition of urate crystals in the joint cavity, resulting in inflammatory arthritis.[20] The disease is characterized by recurrent episodes in the acute phase.",1
"Gout presents as redness, swelling, heat, and pain in the affected joints with limited joint mobility.",1
"NLRP3, a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, is a multimeric protein.",1
"It plays an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses, evidenced by its contribution to autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and SjgrenÕs syndrome.[21] NLRs are the main regulators of immune response.",1
"When the NLPR3 inflammasome is overactivated, it induces the activation of caspase-1, resulting in the high expression and secretion of IL-1_ and IL-18 into the extracellular space.",1
"The secretion aggravates the inflammatory response and increases the degree of joint redness, swelling, heat, and pain.[22] In addition, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the regulation of the immune system and are involved in the process of inflammation and apoptosis.[23] The TLR family recognizes specific signatures of invading microbial pathogens and danger-associated molecules.",1
Its signaling pathway is divided into the MyD88-dependent pathway and TRIF-dependent pathway.,1
"The receptor activates downstream inflammatory cytokine production through signaling.[24] Urate crystals, as danger signaling molecules, induce activation of the TLR4 receptor when it is recognized by TLR4 and interact with the MyD88 adapter to promote the activation of signaling cascades, such as NF-KB and MAKP.",1
"Moreover, they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-_; induce NLRP3 inflammasome expression; and release more inflammatory mediators.[22,25] Miao medicine Tongfengting decoction dispels pathogens and detoxifies, promoting blood circulation, removing turbidity, dispelling wind, and removing dampness.",1
"In preliminary clinical studies, Miao medicine Tongfengting decoction was found to effectively relieve joint pain, reduce inflammatory indicators, and significantly reduce the expression of TLR2/TLR4/MyD88 and other proteins in the joint synovium of gouty arthritis rats, reducing the inflammatory response.[26,27] Through network topology parameter screening, the key targets of Miaoyao Tongfengting Decoction in the treatment of gout are AKT1, TNF, ALB, IL6, TP53, VEGFA, EGFR, SRC, JUN, STAT3, IL1B, EGF, MAPK3, MYC, HSP90AA1, PPARG, HRAS, TLR4, PTGS2, IL10, MMP9, ERBB2, PTPRC.",1
"The target with the highest Degree value was selected for molecular docking verification, and the results showed that the active ingredient could bind well to the target.",1
"AKT1 has the highest degree score in PPI and the strongest binding ability to key compounds, and is considered to be the pivotal target of Miaoyao Tongfengting decoction in the treatment of gout.",1
AKT1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase and is a member of the AKT family.,1
"At present, 3 different isoforms of the AKT family have been found, namely AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3.",1
"AKT has been shown to play a key role in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, and protein synthesis.",1
"In addition, current studies have found that this target also plays an important role in the development and function of innate immune cells, and essential for the regulation of inflammatory responses.[28] AKT can regulate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in neutrophils, and TLR2 is a receptor for Gram-positive bacteria-derived peptidoglycan and lipoproteins, which can be expressed in neutrophils.",1
"In the signal transduction pathway of TLR2, Activated AKT results in the rapid release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.[29,30] That is to say, activated AKT participates in inflammatory response by phosphorylating various downstream signaling molecules in neutrophils.",1
"According to the DC value of the main active ingredients, quercetin, bis-demethoxycurcumin, ferulaic acid, (4E, 6E) -1, 7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)hepta-4, 6-dien-3-one, 2Ñ hydroxy Ñ 9 Ñ phenyl Ñ phenalen Ñ 75 Ñ one, 3-hydroxy- oleanene core compounds.",1
"Among them, quercetin had the highest degree value and largest number of targets.",1
"Quercetin is a natural flavonoid compound that exists in the form of glycosides in fruits, herbs, and vegetables, after clinical trials, no obvious toxicity or side effects occurred, and it has various biological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory properties.[31Ð33] Its anti-inflammatory effect is mainly through inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting the production of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-_, interleukin (IL)-1_, and IL-6, and regulating Th17/Treg balance.",1
"thereby inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and reduces the inflammatory response of joints.[34] The active ingredient can not only reduce the expression level of inflammatory cytokines but also promote the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.[32] Through network pharmacology and molecular docking, the potential targets and related pathways of Miao medicine Tongfengting decoction in the treatment of gout were studied.",1
The results showed that a close relationship existed between the active compounds screened by Miao medicine Tongfengting Decoction and each target.,1
"Additionally, the active compounds had good binding activity.",1
The study provides a novel idea of the mechanism of action of Miao medicine Tongfengting decoction in the treatment of gout.,1
"Additionally, it reflects the characteristics of a multi-target, multi-component, and multi-pathway strategy in the treatment of diseases by TCM, which is in line with the characteristics of TCM treatment based on dialectical treatment and overall concept.",1
"Differential rewarding of work and experience has been a longtime feature of academic medicine, resulting in a series of academic disparities.",1
"These disparities have been collectively called a cultural or minority Òtax,Ó and, when considered beyond academic medicine, exist across all departments, colleges, and schools of institutions of higher learningÐfrom health sciences to disciplines located on university campuses outside of medicine and health.",1
A shared language can provide opportunities for those who champion this work to pool resources for larger impacts across the institution.,1
"This article aims to catalog the terms used across academic medicine disciplines to establish a common language describing the inequities experienced by Black, Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Women, and other underrepresented people as well as queer, disabled, and other historically marginalized or excluded groups.",1
"These ideas are specific to academic medicine in the United States, although many can be used in academic medicine in other countries.",1
"The terms were selected by a team of experts in equity, diversity, and inclusion, (EDI) who are considered national thought leaders in EDI and collectively have over 100 years of scholarship and experience in this area.",1
Minority or (minoritized) faculty experiences are well documented in the academic medicine space as well as on the greater health sciences campuses [1Ð6].,1
"These experiences have been collectively called Òtaxes,Ó or ÒtaxationÓ and they are disproportionately felt by underrepresented faculty in academic medicine regardless of institution type [1, 6].",1
"Examples of these experiences include: minoritized faculty participating in more unpaid diversity efforts, being the targets of racism, isolation, lack of honest effective mentorship, increased clinical responsibilities when compared to non-minority peers, and being considered for promotion later and less often than their non-minoritized peers.",1
These taxes are also described as a subsidy for non-underrepresented faculty in academic medicine or a Òmajority subsidyÓ [1].,1
"With increasing efforts at universities across the country to address issues of equity, diversity, inclusion and anti-racism, it has become clear that there is a need to establish a common vocabulary and shared understanding for faculty and other individuals conducting research in this area.",1
"Much of the literature, as well as these terms, is grounded in the context of academic medicine in the United States, and the authors recognize that all terms will not have the same use in all academic medical settings.",1
"While minoritized medical students surely experience some of the same inequities, we will limit this paper to the faculty experience.",1
This article aspires to introduce a basic glossary to present terms common to all areas of the academic medical environment and ensure a common meaning.,1
"Our glossary defines frequently referenced terms and concepts in equity, diversity and inclusion work that are used in a variety of academic and non-academic settings.",1
"The terms were selected by a team of experts in equity, diversity, and inclusion, (EDI) who are considered national thought leaders in EDI and collectively have over 100 years of scholarship and experience in this area.",1
"In addition, we have included a compilation of terms that have been introduced into the literature by the authors. (KMC, JCW, LHP, JER, WAS).",1
"When viewed as a whole, these terms will help equity, diversity, and inclusion scholars and officers alike find a common lexicon to describe the minority faculty experience and to ensure that equity outcomes are achieved in academic medical and health sciences settings.",1
The term ÒredliningÓ is associated with the historical practice of outlining areas with sizable Black populations in red ink on maps where banks and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) denied mortgage and insurance products [2].,1
"ÒRedliningÓ now extends to discriminatory practices of denying or charging more for a broad range of services, including banking, insurance, health care, consumer products, and education to marginalized communities.",1
"In health care, an example of a redlining practice is the inequitable geographic distribution of health services and facilities within marginalized communities [3].",1
"This disparity results in decrease access, poorer health outcomes, and increased out-of-pocket costs such as transportation, time missed from work, and childcare expense to seek healthcare.",1
"The decreased concentration of health services and facilities creates health deserts like food deserts in areas that have less access to grocery stores, thereby limiting access to affordable nutritious food.",1
"Academic redlining refers to the systematic exclusion of students from underrepresented backgrounds from entry into medicine using standardized test hard cutoffs, such as the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT).",1
The use of an arbitrary cutoff contributes to the persistent lack of diversity in medicine [4].,1
"In academia, biases are preconceived notions about individuals or groups that could be based on stereotypes, racism, sexism, or other forms of oppression.",1
Biases allow their users to take Òcognitive shortcutsÓ instead of learning about the individuals or groups.,1
"Individual biases are snap judgements that can lead to inappropriate decisions and discriminatory, oppressive practices [5].",1
Unconscious or implicit biases are a sub-set of bias and will be addressed here.,1
"Unconscious bias, also known as implicit bias, refers to attitudes or stereotypes that are outside our awareness but affect our understanding, our interactions, and our decisions [6].",1
"Much attention has been given to unconscious biases, namely because they lead to, in effect, racist, sexist or other oppressive actions by offenders who do not identify as racist, sexist, etc.",1
"Regardless of intention, unconscious biases hurt people of color, and universities across the world are working on the elimination of this form of bias.",1
"The framework stemming from ingrained racist ideologies that suggest Underrepresented Minority (URM) faculty professional development is needed due to deficiencies in the faculty member rather than the deficiencies of the institution in regard to inclusivity, racist policies, and equity [7, 8].",1
"It includes the bias that predominantly white institutions (PWI) are devoid of institutionalized racism due to the longstanding history of white privilege as the norm [9, 10].",1
"A similar term, deficit model, refers to the skills that some faculty may lack due to multiple factors [11Ð13], but the deficiency model terminology is person based and not skills based.",1
"This comes from the historical concept that minority faculty are deficient, essentially an extension of racist ideas that have permeated academia for millennia [14, 15].",1
Disparity means difference.,1
"In healthcare and in academia more broadly, the term disparities are usually used to describe differences in outcomes between groups.",1
"For example, a promotion disparity would be described when comparing women and men in the same discipline and noticing that women are promoted less often [16].",1
"A healthcare disparity would be one where women of color die at higher rates of breast cancer when compared to white women [17, 18].",1
"Disparities are a hallmark of our society, and elimination of disparities moves us towards a more equitable society.",1
"Distance traveled describes differences among faculty in the path to their present position; for many URM faculty, arriving at this position entailed more tasks than for non-URM faculty [19].",1
"This may mean having to work during high school, college, or even medical school to help meet financial obligations at home; taking extended leaves of absence to care for loved ones; dealing with health, legal, or educational challenges that impede academic progress, etc.",1
These challenges may extend time to degree beyond four years for undergraduate and/or medical school or beyond eight years for both.,1
Faculty who have overcome these additional challenges are said to have a greater distance travelled when compared to those who did not experience these challenges.,1
Gate Blocking describes the result of institutional actions and institutional neglect in the setting of institutional racism that essentially blocks the gate of progress or advancement for underrepresented faculty in academic medicine [19].,1
Underrepresented minority faculty are gate blocked from promotion and tenure and leadership opportunities and can be subjected to pseudo-leadership and minority and gratitude taxation (see below).,1
Institutional action or inaction leads to feelings of imposter syndrome and reverse imposter syndrome for underrepresented minority faculty [19].,1
"This phenomenon can be experienced in any situation where academic promotion is controlled by institutional leaders, and underrepresented minority faculty can be tokenized.",1
"Not only does this group suffer from lack of advancement as a result of being gate blocked, they may also leave academic medicine [19].",1
"Those who have imposter syndrome doubt their abilities or accomplishments, and fear being exposed as a fraud because of consistent messages that they donÕt deserve success because of one or all their identities.",1
This happens even in the situation where they are the most qualified for the position they occupy [20].,1
"First coined as a phenomenon observed in white women serving in higher education [21], This phenomenon is also observed in underrepresented minority faculty in academic medicine and across higher education, regardless of gender identification [19, 22].",1
"Imposter syndrome steals energy from achievement and consumes it in self-doubt, and other damaging pursuits.",1
"The mental health implications can shorten careers, frustrate individual faculty members, and keep faculty members from aspiring to higher positions [23].",1
"This social phenomenon was first described by Chester Pierce, M.D., a prominent Harvard-trained Black psychiatrist: ÒThe subtle, cumulative mini-assault is the substance of todayÕs racismÓ [24].",1
Microaggressions are the regular or daily experiences that carry messages of insult due to group membership.,1
"These are everyday slights, indignities, and put-downs that members of marginalized groups experience in their everyday interactions.",1
Individuals who perpetrate the microaggressions are often unaware that they have engaged in an offensive or demeaning way.,1
"Wing Sue has significantly expanded this work to address various forms of microaggressions, suggests a process model, and discusses engagement in the workplace or classroom.",1
"Wing SueÕs work has shown that microaggressions are not limited to race/ethnicity or faculty situations, and the expansion of this definition to women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ_+) individuals, and others serves to increase awareness and understanding of the damaging effects for multiple marginalized groups [25Ð27].",1
"Women who become mothers sacrifice career progress, lose wages, and are stigmatized, while men are rewarded [28].",1
"Early experimental work by multiple scholars showed that in addition to the above challenges, mothers also are perceived as less committed to their jobs [29Ð31].",1
Underrepresented faculty in academic medicine are more likely to be in entry-level rank and less likely to be tenured.,1
Power distance refers to the distance between a traditional junior faculty member or other entry-level position and senior leadership.,1
"This distance may cause the underrepresented faculty member to defer to the opinions, ideas and plans of senior leadership even when those plans may be at odds with their own beliefs and potentially harmful to their careerÓ [22].",1
Gaslighting is a psychological manipulation that causes an individual or group to question their own sanity or perception of reality.,1
"First used in a play and a film called ÒGas LightÓ [32], the term was applied to sociology in the 1960s as pertaining to intimate partnerships, the term has evolved to describe any toxic dynamic in which an individual/group with power and control consciously or unconsciously deceives a targeted individual/group, causing them to question their own judgement.",1
"This can lead to burnout, insecurity, and an inability to maintain a stable and thriving career [33].",1
"In academic medicine, gaslighting creates cognitive dissonance or low self-esteem in the underrepresented minority faculty member, and can exacerbate imposter syndrome, isolation, and emotional destabilization.",1
"Gaslighting often manifests in the form of denial, misdirection, and misinformation.",1
"It gradually erodes the faculty memberÕs confidence, causing them to question their role in and contributions to the department.",1
"Psychological vulnerability causes URM and women faculty to limit their contributions and constantly edit their thoughts, their words, and their actions.",1
"This happens in the absence of psychological safety, the shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking [34].",1
"An example would be URM faculty having a meeting outside of the department, or even outside of the institution to avoid psychological vulnerability.",1
First coined in 2003 by Dr.,1
"William A Smith at the University of Utah, this describes the results of natural race-related stress responses to distressing mental and emotional conditions.",1
Racial battle fatigue is a systemic race-related repetitive stress injury.,1
"Consequently, poor health or illness can emerge from constantly combating biopsychosocial factors experienced as racially discriminatory, dismissive, demeaning, insensitive, hostile, or violent.",1
"This injury was first described as a phenomenon that affected Black faculty on predominantly white campuses but has evolved to describe the experiences of all racially marginalized and underrepresented people, irrespective of their interlocking identities.",1
"According to Dr. Smith, Òracial battle fatigue helps to explain the causes, manifestation, and pre-mature deaths of targets of racismÓ [35].",1
A system of discrimination against Black and other people of color based on perpetrators Ô perception of the victimÕs phenotype.,1
"In the United States and worldwide, the direction of racism as a system is anti-Black, or anti-Asian, etc.",1
"Racism manifests itself in many ways, but always advantages one race over another [36, 37].",1
Sometimes called Òracism without racistsÓ it is the racism that is perpetuated by policies and institutional governance systems that favor white men and women over all others [37].,1
"The evidence for this is in the low representation of women of color in leadership, the small percentage of Asians in medical institution leadership when they represent 25% of all medical faculty, and the small percentage of URM faculty in academic settings across the United States.",1
Institutionalized racism is also manifest outside of the academic setting.,1
Historical examples of redlining and Jim Crow laws are examples of institutional racism at its strongest.,1
"Yet, even today, it is manifest in higher mortgage rates for Black and Latinx borrowers, efforts across the U.S. to silence minority voters through stricter voter registration laws, and the association between low socioeconomic status and race.",1
"While these systems of oppression were not invented by anyone alive today, they are still perpetuated through institutions.",1
"Institutionalized racism also has a role in health disparities, as medical professionals throughout the world are taught that Black race is associated with higher risk for certain diseases and is associated with poorer health outcomes.",1
"Describes how underrepresented minority faculty can feel when they are made pseudo-leaders at the hands of institutional racism, by academic institutions.",1
"In contrast to imposter syndrome, in reverse imposter syndrome underrepresented faculty are tokenized and placed in leadership roles only for the diversity they bring when they are not trained, prepared, or supported for such an opportunity.",1
This tokenization opens them up to manipulation by senior leaders due to limited knowledge and training for the leadership role.,1
"As reverse imposters, underrepresented minority faculty may forego trainings and opportunities that would promote their growth in skills within their current institution.",1
"A psychological phenomenon where an individualÕs performance in a task is affected, often adversely, due to the fear or anxiety of confirming a negative stereotype about how that group will stereotypically perform in that task [38].",1
"Rooted in the work of Claude Steele and Joshua Aaronson, numerous psychology experiments have documented examples: When primed with the stereotype of underperformance, People of Color and Women underperformed on standardized tests compared to White People and Men.",1
White people underperformed in athletic tasks compared to Black people.,1
"White people underperformed in cognitive tasks when compared to Asian groups, especially in STEM subjects.",1
"SteeleÕs most recent book, Whistling Vivaldi, summarizes many of these experiments and addresses strategies to address stereotype threat, including a) ÒprimingÓ those at risk of stereotype threat with information about the threat and expressing confidence in their ability to overcome it, and b) having counter messages in the environment that suggest a sense of welcome [39Ð41].",1
"The practice of making only a perfunctory or symbolic effort to do a particular thing, such as by recruiting a person from an underrepresented group only to prevent criticism and give the appearance that people are being included or treated fairly [42, 43].",1
"Tokenism is designed to show that an organization values equity, diversity, and inclusion.",1
"Frequently the most junior or the most professionally vulnerable URM faculty member is invited to participate in leadership discussions, with leaders understanding that junior voice from a URM background is easily manipulated or controlled [44].",1
Tokenism is also used as an excuse not to include URM voices in leadership because leaders do not want to Òtokenize.Ó The antidote for tokenization is to have multiple URM voices at the highest leadership levels and on decision making boards.,1
White manning is behavior that some white men exhibit that ignores both humility and the vulnerable and allows him to pretend that he is the sole expert on all things.,1
This attitude led to immediate closure of college campuses at the start of the COVID19 pandemic without considering the needs of minoritized and marginalized students.,1
"In academic medicine, it allowed for a delayed response of many hospital systems across the US including the failure to see the vulnerability of many frontline workers who were predominantly African American and Latinx.",1
ÒWhite manningÓ justifies the continued lack of diversity in the physician work force.,1
"It also blames URM students, residents and faculty for their lack of representation and not systemic racism [45].",1
Uncompensated work-related duties that require dedicated time often performed at work but often on off hours.,1
These duties are less likely to contribute to career advancement.,1
"Some examples are posing for brochure pictures, taking notes at meetings, participating in, and organizing social events, committee participation etc.",1
"Women are asked to do more citizenship tasks than men and feel that gender plays a significant role [46, 47].",1
"Originally coined by Dr. Amado Padilla, this term refers to the additional, uncompensated burdens placed on minority faculty in academic settings [48].",1
"Some of these additional burdens have to do with uncompensated diversity work, pressures to be the spokesperson for the institution without compensation, etc.",1
"This Òtaxation Ò is the model for the other Òtaxes Ò listed in this paper and has been used to describe additional burdens for women, for racial/ethnic minorities, etc.",1
This tax refers to the learned attitudes of URM faculty members from lived experience that they should be ÒgratefulÓ that academia has Ògiven them a chanceÓ or Òtaken a riskÓ in hiring them [49].,1
"It keeps URM faculty from asking for resources and time that are allotted to non-URM faculty because, if you do ask, you are not grateful for your chance.",1
This tax can result in additional service work or responsibility taken on to show thanks or commitment to another person or a team.,1
"It can also make it difficult to say ÒnoÓ as there is the potential for being perceived as ÒungratefulÓ if that extra work is rejected, no matter the reason [49].",1
This work is taken on even if the individual is no longer experiencing professional growth.,1
"As a result, the individual may avoid seeking new opportunities and delay academic advancement.",1
"Most pronounced for Black women, this refers to the exclusion of the experiences of women of color from discussions of women in academia.",1
Woman in academic circles usually means white woman [50].,1
"In addition, white women also are made to feel invisible and unvalued in many academic spaces, particularly in male-dominated disciplines [51].",1
"The additional burden of responsibility and expectations placed on underrepresented minorities than those who identify with the dominant culture; all in addition to coping with and managing daily, institutionalized bigotry in professional and personal lives.",1
"ÒThe proportion of Black, Latino, and Native American faculty in US academic medical centers has remained almost unchanged over the last 20 years.",1
"This tax is, in reality, very complex, and a major source of inequity in academic medicine.",1
The Òminority taxÓ is better described as an Underrepresented Minority in Medicine (URMM) faculty responsibility disparity.,1
"This disparity is evident in many areas: diversity efforts, racism, isolation, mentorship, clinical responsibilities, and promotionÓ [52].",1
The intersection of woman taxes and minority taxes.,1
"For most, this is an exponential increase, and not a simple summation.",1
"These include tokenism, gratitude taxation, and the vulnerabilities that are magnified by sexism and racism [50, 53].",1
"This minority woman tax has also been described by Hishfield and Joseph as identity taxation for women, especially women of color in academia [54].",1
"Women with the same experience, productivity, and clinical expertise are paid less than men.",1
"In the United States, women physicians earn 75 cents on the dollar compared with their male counterparts, even after accounting for numerous potential confounders.",1
The 2020 numbers show the same disparity despite the increase in overall compensation.,1
"Many women, because of competing demands, are being paid for 80% time but continue to perform at 100% time.",1
Men who work part-time usually do so to fulfill another career goal while women do so to care for children or elderly parents.,1
"At many institutions, reduction in time commitment leads to a disproportionate decrease in benefits like healthcare coverage and lack of opportunity to move into leadership positions.",1
This also diminishes the productivity in scholarship due to being assigned uncompensated service-related tasks [55].,1
There is also a documented gender gap in National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant applications and funding [56Ð58].,1
"This glossary was designed to create a common vocabulary for those interested in equity, diversity and inclusion work in academic medicine and the health sciences, with a focus on the work done in the United States.",1
"While this is not designed to be an exhaustive list, it has value as it combines terms that are frequently used, but not always understood in the same way.",1
"This glossary can be used in training and onboarding for academic leaders to ensure that experiences common to minoritized faculty are named and can open a pathway for deeper understanding of faculty who have been Òothered.Ó In the United States, amid increasing divides in political and cultural thought, a common vocabulary can serve as a nidus for unity.",1
The terms and the examples provided can also help leaders recognize behaviors and attitudes that are detrimental to the academy and find ways to eliminate them.,1
"In addition, the taxation and the other forms of oppression listed could serve as an impetus for policy and institutional change to ensure that our institutions of higher learning become bastions and leaders in equity.",1
"Institutional commitment to the elimination of the inequities described can be facilitated by dialogue, but true change happens when the policies that govern behavior are changed to address the phenomena described in this lexicon.",1
"Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) work in academic medicine has been studied for decades, and due to the pandemic and the subsequent aftermath of racial justice protests in the United States and internationally, it is receiving renewed attention.",1
"Because it is a rapidly changing field, this update can serve academic medicine leaders as they seek definitions and a common vocabulary to continue this work.",1
Mitigation strategies and behaviors that individuals and institutions can use to address the phenomena defined by the terms in this work are provided in Table 1.,1
"Within the growing geriatric population, there is an increasing need for emergency operations.",1
Optimizing outcomes may require a structured system of surgical care based on key quality indicators.,1
"To investigate this, the present study sought to answer two questions.",1
"First, to what degree does hospital emergency operative volume impact mortality for geriatric patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) operations?",1
"Second, at what procedure-specific hospital volume will geriatric patients undergoing an emergency operation achieve at or better than average mortality risk?",1
Retrospective cohort study of geriatric patients (³65years) who underwent one of ten EGS operations identified from the California State Inpatient Database (2010-2011).,1
"Beta-logistic generalized linear regression was employed, with the hospital as the unit of analysis, to investigate the relationship between hospital operative volume and in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality.",1
Hospital operative volume-thresholds to optimize probability of survival were defined.,1
"41,860 surgeries were evaluated at 299 hospitals.",1
"For each operation, mortality decreased as hospital emergency operative volume increased (p<0.001 for each operation); for every standardized increase in volume (meaning +1 natural logarithm of volume), the reduction in mortality ranged from 14% for colectomy to 61% for appendectomy.",1
"Hospital volume-thresholds, which optimize to 95% probability of survival, varied by operation, with a mean of 14 operations over 2 years.",1
"More than 50% of hospitals did not meet the threshold benchmarks, representing 22% of patients.",1
Survival rates for geriatric patients were significantly improved when emergency operations were performed at hospitals with higher operative volumes.,1
"Consistent with all active Quality Programs of the American College of Surgeons, hospital operative volume appears to be an important metric of surgical quality for older patients undergoing emergency operations.",1
Survival rates for geriatric patients were significantly higher when emergency general surgery (EGS) operations were performed at hospitals with higher emergency geriatric operative volumes.,1
"Operative volume seems to be a key quality indicator and determinant of survival for older EGS patients, and a principle driver of variation in EGS-hospital performance.",1
"As the United States (US) geriatric population increases(1), there is significant interest in ensuring safe and high-quality surgical care for older persons.",1
"The American College of Surgeons (ACS), in concert with the John A.",1
"Hartford Foundation, has formed the Coalition for Quality in Geriatric Surgery (CQGS) with over 50 stakeholder organizations working to create verifiable hospital-based standards to improve outcomes for older surgical patients.(2) The ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and the American Geriatric Society have jointly published best practice guidelines on the ÒOptimal Perioperative Management of the Geriatric Patient.Ó(3) The National Quality Forum, one of the nationÕs leading patient safety organizations, has endorsed specific quality measures for geriatric surgical patients.(4) And the ACS NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Pilot has developed and tested a quality improvement dataset with metrics targeted to an older population, including cognition, decision-making, mobility, and function.(5, 6) At present, much of the focus is on optimizing outcomes for older patients undergoing elective operations.(7, 8) However, as the US population ages, the number of older patients who will require emergency surgical intervention will increase.(9-11) Current data show that, depending on the general surgery operation, anywhere from 10% to 44% of operations in older persons are emergent.(12, 13) This presents additional challenges since emergency surgery in older patients is associated with higher morbidity and mortality(14-16) as well as increased costs(17, 18) relative to elective operations.",1
"Accordingly, there is a significant opportunity, with broad clinical implications, to improve the care of older persons with acute surgical diseases.(19-21) The ACS Quality Programs(22) provide a valuable, tested framework on which to base improvements in emergency surgery for geriatric patients.",1
"For many surgical disciplines, quality improvement is synonymous with an accreditation process which verifies surgical centers using specific criteria to ensure standards of care and optimize outcomes.",1
"Across multiple surgical subspecialties, including bariatrics(23), trauma(24), and pediatric surgery(25), discipline-specific hospital volume is a fundamental criterion of accreditation, and serves as a quality indicator that institutions must meet to become a verified center.",1
"To test the concept that hospital emergency operative volume is a key quality indicator and determinant of mortality in older patients undergoing surgical emergencies, the present study sought to answer two questions.",1
"First, to what degree does hospital emergency operative volume influence mortality for geriatric patients undergoing common emergency general surgery (EGS) operations?",1
"Second, at what procedure-specific hospital volume will geriatric patients undergoing an emergency operation achieve at or better than average mortality risk?",1
The hypothesis was that higher hospital volume would be associated with lower post-operative in-hospital mortality.,1
An additional hypothesis was that hospital emergency operative volume reaches a threshold above which nearly all hospitals performing the emergency operation in older patients would realize the average mortality risk or lower.,1
"This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all geriatric patients (³65 years) who underwent one of ten EGS operations in the state of California over a 24-month period, from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.",1
"The ten operations analyzed were: appendectomy; cholecystectomy; colectomy; inguinal & femoral hernia repair (analyzed together); lysis of adhesions (LOA; no bowel resections were performed in the LOA group, by definition); excision of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI); repair of perforated peptic ulcer disease (either gastric or duodenal ulcers); small bowel resection; umbilical hernia repair; and ventral hernia repair.",1
Both laparoscopic and open operations were included; trauma operations were excluded.,1
Two datasets were used.,1
The first was the State Inpatient Database (SID) for California (data from 2010 and 2011).,1
"The state of California was chosen as it is the most populous state in the US (population of 37 million in 2011), with a diverse population and varied geography, with both urban and rural areas.",1
"The SID is part of a family of datasets developed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.(26) Data abstracted included patient demographics, chronic health conditions, hospital-based metrics, and in-hospital mortality.",1
"The second dataset was the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals Database for 2010 and 2011.(27) The same California acute care hospitals in the SID and the AHA were paired, thus enabling risk-adjustment at the hospital level.",1
"For the current analyses, only patients undergoing urgent/emergency operations with specific EGS diagnoses were included.",1
"Patients were identified using International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition (ICD-9), procedural codes (Appendix A); only patients who were listed in the SID dataset as having undergone one of the ten operations as a primary core operation were included (as opposed to a secondary operation/procedure).",1
ICD-9 diagnosis codes (Appendix B) identified patients with a specific diagnosis of an EGS condition.,1
"Given the ability to longitudinally track patients within SID, patients were not included more than once.",1
"The chosen acute surgical conditions are among most prevalent emergent surgical diseases requiring operative intervention in the US, and have a non-trivial risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality.(28-30) An operation was defined as being performed urgently/emergently if it was associated with an admission not scheduled, as defined by the SID unscheduled admission variable.",1
The transfer status of patients was accounted for in the inclusion/exclusion criteria; Òtransfer statusÓ refers to the actual movement of a patient to or from one acute care hospital to another in California.,1
"If a patient urgently/emergently underwent an operation at one acute care hospital and was later transferred out to a second hospital, mortality was attributed to the transferring hospital that initially provided care; this is in keeping with the public reporting of mortality rates.(31) Hospital volume was defined as the total number of patients having urgent/emergent operations at each acute care hospital over the two-year period.",1
"Pediatric hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals were excluded from the analysis, as were governmental hospitals such as VeteranÕs Affairs (VA) hospitals.",1
Any hospital that performed fewer than three of the specific operation of interest over the two years was excluded from the analyses.,1
"Hospitals doing an average of one emergent operation per year were not representative of the hospital types of interest, nor did they contribute reliable information regarding a mortality rate.",1
Operative mortality was defined as a death which occurred during the patientÕs index hospitalization.,1
"The first research question evaluated the degree to which hospital operative volume influences hospital mortality rate, for each of the ten specified procedures.",1
"An ecological analysis was performed based on the hospital characteristics as predictors of the hospitalÕs mortality rates, not the individual patientÕs characteristics as predictors of the patientÕs mortality; in other words, the ÔhospitalÕ was the unit of analysis.",1
"An ecological analysis is a reasonable and valid approach for a study of the relationship between a hospital-level contextual risk factor (in this case volume) and a hospital-level contextual outcome (incidence rate of mortality).(32) Beta-logistic generalized linear regression(33) was used to examine the relationship between hospital emergency operative volume and postoperative inpatient mortality, with adjustment for both a hospitalÕs patient case-mix as well as other relevant hospital-type characteristics.",1
The primary outcome measure was the proportion (a value from 0 to 1) of patients with in-hospital mortality over the 2-year period (defined as the number of patients who died during that admission after undergoing an emergency operation divided by all patients undergoing that same type of emergency operation at that hospital over the two years).,1
"Mortality proportion data typically exhibit an S-shaped, or sigmoidal, curve with asymptotes at the limits of zero and one when plotted against a predictor.",1
"In contrast to the beta-logistic generalized linear regression with logit link function used in the current study, ordinary regression does not capture this relationship.",1
"The beta distribution supports a range from zero to one, and the logit link ensures that the predicted mean stays within bounds (0, 1).",1
The model regressed the mortality proportion at each hospital on the natural logarithm of the hospital volume plus hospital-level characteristics as covariates to adjust for variation in case-mix across hospitals.,1
"The general equations for the beta regression models, by operation, are available upon request to the corresponding author.",1
The natural logarithm transformation of volume was used in the model for the operative volume predictor.,1
The results are based on a +1 standardized increase in the natural logarithm transformation of volume.,1
"To interpret this from an operative volume standpoint, one must transform the natural log integer into a hospital operative volume Ð see footnotes in Table 2 and Appendix C for full explanations of this.",1
There are two major reasons why this natural logarithm transformation was chosen for the models.,1
"The first is because the logit is the canonical link function for the beta regression, and therefore both the predictor of interest (hospital urgent/emergent operative volume) and the outcome of interest (proportion of mortality) would both be on the natural log scale.",1
"The second is that, from a practical interpretation standpoint, hospital volume is believed to have a multiplicative effect rather than an additive effect.",1
"For example, an additive effect would suggest that a difference of 20 operations between hospitals with volumes of 5 operations vs 25 operations would be equivalent to the difference of 20 operations between hospitals with volumes of 100 operations vs 120 operations; the multiplicative effect would interpret this differently, saying the difference between hospitals with volumes of 5 operations vs 25 operations would be 5 times as large, and the difference between hospitals with volumes of 100 operations vs 120 operations would be 1.2 times as large.",1
Patient case-mix characteristics were included as hospital-level means or percentages to serve as covariates in the models that adjust for case-mix differences between hospitals.,1
"These included mean age, mean Elixhauser-van Walraven comorbidity index, and percentages of gender, race, and payer status.",1
"The Elixhauser-van Walraven is a widely-used, validated, weighted measure of a patientÕs chronic disease burden.(34) Coexisting conditions were identified in the SID dataset using ICD-9 diagnosis codes, which were then used to calculate an Elixhuaser-van Walraven comorbidity index.",1
Unadjusted as well as multivariable risk-adjusted models were tested to predict in-hospital mortality; odds ratios represented the effects of hospital volume on survival proportion.,1
"A pseudo-R2 statistic(35, 36) was calculated for each beta regression model as a generalized linear model analog to the linear regression R2 statistic, denoting the proportion of the variance of the dependent variable explained by the model predictor of interest with covariates.",1
"Importantly, the values for the beta regression model pseudo-R2 statistic are very different than the values for the linear regression R2 statistic: a wider range of pseudo-R2 values represent good model fit compared to the standard R2.",1
Patient-level characteristics were compared between those who died and those who survived.,1
Chi-squared (_2) tests were used to compare differences in proportions for categorical variables; these data were summarized by frequencies with percentages.,1
Group means were compared using two-sample t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables; data were summarized by mean values with standard deviations (SD).,1
Hospital-level characteristics (medical school affiliation; trauma center status; high technology capability) were evaluated and presented as frequencies with percentages.,1
"A hospital had a Òmedical school affiliationÓ if it was defined in the AHA dataset as a teaching hospital as reported to the American Medical Association, which accredits medical schools.(37) A hospital was considered a Òtrauma centerÓ if it was either a Level 1 or Level 2 trauma center as defined and verified by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma(24) (note the AHA dataset designation of trauma center, which was missing many variables and is based on state-level standards, was not used).",1
"A hospital was defined as having Òhigh technology capabilityÓ if it performed adult open heart surgery and/or major liver or heart organ transplantation; this variable is therefore a proxy for a hospitalÕs ability to manage and treat intensely sick patients in the perioperative period, as these operations often demand intensive care unit admission and blood banking abilities, among others.(27, 38) The second research question was at what hospital operative volume would patients undergoing an emergency operation realize the average or lower mortality risk for that operation.",1
The volume-threshold was analyzed using the results of the beta regression models.,1
The threshold (also referred to as the Òthreshold benchmarkÓ or ÒbenchmarkÓ) was defined as the hospital operative volume above which ³95% of the hospitals were performing at or better than the average risk-adjusted mortality rate.,1
"For example, if a patient were to have a non-elective cholecystectomy at a hospital with a cholecystectomy operative volume greater than the volume-threshold, there would be a 95% chance that that patientÕs mortality risk (as defined by hospital mortality proportion) would be lower than the average risk-adjusted mortality for all hospitals performing cholecystectomies.",1
Average mortality risk was defined and calculated by operation as the mean in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality at all acute care hospitals included in the analysis performing that specific EGS operation.,1
A p-value <0.05 was defined as statistically significant.,1
"All statistical analyses were conducting using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).",1
This study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee (HIC) of the Yale University Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) for biomedical research.,1
"Of the 425 acute care hospitals in California, the number meeting the inclusion criterion performing emergent operations ranged from 62 performing umbilical hernia repairs to 298 performing cholecystectomies; 299 different acute care hospitals were included.",1
Further breakdown of hospital level characteristics by operation are found in Appendix D.,1
"The three highest volume operations were cholecystectomy (n=17427), colectomy (6727), and appendectomy (4857).",1
"The three lowest volume operations were umbilical hernia repair (268), excision of NSTI (666), and repair of perforated peptic ulcer disease (871).",1
"At 299 different acute care hospitals in California, 41,860 patients underwent EGS operations (Table 1).",1
"Overall unadjusted mortality rate was 5.5%, though it varied significantly by operation (Appendix E): 0.6% for appendectomy; 1.5% for cholecystectomy; 14.2% for colectomy; 2.3% for inguinal and femoral hernia repair; 6.2% for LOA; 11.4% for NSTI excision; 17.7% for repair of perforated peptic ulcer disease; 12.6% for small bowel resection; 1.1% for umbilical hernia repair; and 2.4% for ventral hernia repair.",1
"Relative to the non-decedents, the decedents were more likely to be white, have a payor source of Medicare, older and had higher van Walraven co-morbidity scores (Table 1).",1
Open versus laparoscopic operations did not significantly impact mortality outcome.,1
"Further breakdown of patient level characteristics, by operation, is found in Appendix E.",1
"Multivariable beta regression models found that risk-adjusted mortality significantly decreased as volume increased for all ten EGS operations, although the relative magnitude of this inverse relationship varied substantially by procedure (Table 2).",1
"Relative to other covariates in the beta regression models, hospital operative volume was the most important characteristic with significant impact on mortality for every operation studied (Appendix C).",1
"Even with operations that have a lower risk of mortality (<2%), there remained a survival benefit to having the operation done at a higher volume hospital.",1
The inverse volume to mortality relationship is shown graphically in the beta fit plots for all ten operations (Figure 1).,1
"For each operation, the high-volume hospitals tend to cluster together, indicating less variability and higher precision, while at the lower volume hospitals there is wide variation in mortality.",1
"In terms of model fit, each operationÕs beta regression pseudo R2 indicated that each model fit the data well; pseudo R2 values ranged from 0.16 for repair of perforated viscus to 0.74 for appendectomy.",1
"Full results of beta regression by operation, including hospital-level and patient-level covariates that were significantly associated with death, are found in Appendix C.",1
The hospital operative volume-thresholds at which there was a 95% chance that that institution performed at or better than the average risk-adjusted mortality rate varied by operation (Table 3).,1
from 38 cases over two years for colectomy to 5 cases over two years for umbilical hernia repair.,1
"On average, more than 50% of the hospitals did not meet the volume-thresholds, representing 22% of patients.",1
"The number of hospitals failing to meet these threshold mortality standards varied by operation type, from 30% of all hospitals for cholecystectomy to 81% of institutions for repair of perforated peptic ulcer disease.",1
"The number of operations performed at these below-threshold institutions also varied, from 7% of all cases for cholecystectomy to 64% of the operations for repair of perforated peptic ulcer disease.",1
"Consistent with the studyÕs primary hypothesis, higher hospital emergency operative volume was independently and significantly associated with higher probability of survival for patients ³65 years undergoing each of ten urgent/emergency EGS operations.",1
"For each procedure, hospital emergency operative volume reaches a specific threshold above which nearly all hospitals achieve at or better than average risk-adjusted survival.",1
"This volume-threshold provides an operationally defined, empirically-based, objective indicator of operative performance.",1
These results suggest that hospital operative volume is an important metric of surgical quality for older patients undergoing emergency operations.,1
The ACS CQGS is working to create verifiable hospital-based standards to improve outcomes for older surgical patients.,1
"In a recent publication(39), a modified RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Method was used to establish a list of valid standards to improve the surgical care of older adults.",1
Hospital operative volume was not on this list.,1
"This is understandable, as using hospital operative volume as a benchmark-criteria for surgical quality is not perfect, and has its critics.(40) However, based on the current study, the CQGS should consider establishing hospital operative volume as one of the fundamental benchmarks of high-quality emergency surgical care and including volume in the accreditation process for geriatric surgical centers.",1
"This criterion has been successfully implemented for other surgical subspecialties such as bariatrics(23), trauma(24), and pediatric surgery(25), which use hospital volume as one of the standards for the verification process.",1
"Variability is inherent to any outcome in medicine and surgery.(41) One of the goals of quality improvement initiatives is to minimize this variability so that outcomes are more predictable, thus saving lives and decreasing morbidity.",1
"Part of the survival variability in the current study is explained by hospital operative volume, which turns out to be the most significant predictor of survival for all EGS operations in this geriatric cohort.",1
"For some EGS operations, the survival variability is also explained by patient-level characteristics (see Appendix C), though their relative importance was less consistent.",1
Patient characteristics such as comorbidity status (for cholecystectomy; colectomy; lysis of adhesions; small bowel resection) and age (for appendectomy; repair of perforated peptic ulcers; umbilical hernia repair) were significantly associated with mortality.,1
The differences observed between procedure volume and patient characteristics on in-hospital mortality after EGS operations demonstrates that predicting outcomes in an older population is operation dependent.,1
"Given the lack of consistency in associations for patient characteristics in the regression models, the results may also mean that traditional patient-level metrics of risk-adjustment (age, gender, race, comorbidities, etc) lack specificity in an older population.",1
"Future outcomes research on older populations should look beyond these traditional metrics and assess more geriatric-centered variables (frailty, function, cognition, etc), which may better characterize an aged population.",1
"In the SID dataset that was employed for the present study, such geriatric-specific variables were not available.",1
The survival variability seen among hospitals in this study is also likely due to processes of care and institutional cultures (such as high reliable organizations) that are characteristic of certain medical centers.,1
"While such indices are best measured with qualitative data, they are inherently captured Ð though not quantified Ð in the beta regression models which use the hospital as the unit of analysis.",1
"This is a distinct strength of the current study Ð though additional qualitative investigation is needed to specifically define these processes, structures, and cultures.",1
"The use of an ecological analysis, with outcome as a hospitalÕs mortality incidence rate rather than a patientÕs probability of death, is a strength of this study.",1
"It allows a comparison of hospitals as a function of procedure volume, rather than comparing patient-types within or between hospitals.",1
The risk of mortality for individual patients within hospitals via multilevel models with random hospital effects was not modelled as this would assume conditional independence of patient outcomes within hospitals.,1
"Such a modeling paradigm ignores contextual effects on mortality risk; for example, if you were the only high-risk patient at a hospital, or among exclusively high-risk patients at a hospital with the same volume, you would have the same risk of procedure failure.",1
"In addition to multilevel models with random hospital effects, another alternative to beta regression would be generalized estimating equations with ÔsandwichÕ variance estimation.",1
"Such a model, however, assumes all patients are from the same population, but adjusts variance estimates to acknowledge that there are correlated, not independent, observations.",1
"Relative to these alternative analytic strategies, ecological analysis is a more reasonable approach for modeling the true relationship between hospital operative volume and mortality proportion.",1
Several issues regarding emergency operative intervention in an older population warrant further discussion.,1
The first is the transfer of patients between institutions.,1
"Based on the volume-threshold definitions, the results suggest that 22% of geriatric EGS patients, approximately 9344 people over the 2 year study period in California, would potentially have benefited from transfer to a higher-volume institution for their operation.",1
This could be problematic as it has the potential to overwhelm higher volume centers.,1
"Furthermore, emergency surgical conditions are inherently time-sensitive diagnoses requiring time-sensitive operations.",1
"As such, delaying an urgent/emergent operation by a transfer can also be potentially problematic especially given the evidence that transferred patients have poorer outcomes for time-sensitive surgical emergencies.(42, 43) However, there are few reliable data to support these claims in the geriatric EGS population.",1
"Given the underappreciated complexity of emergency operations in older patients, some have advocated that urgent/emergent EGS operations should be daytime-only procedures.(44) Taken together, based on the present knowledge of EGS disease processes, there may exist a safe window of time during which a majority of older patients with EGS conditions could be temporized with standard medical treatment and transferred to higher-volume centers for operative intervention, perhaps within 6-12 hours of presentation and diagnosis.",1
Further investigation is necessary and warranted.,1
The second consideration Ð which builds on the first and is based on the fact that most rural hospitals are lower operative volume institutions Ð is the practical limitation of emergency surgical care in more remote settings.,1
A structured system of EGS care that mandates transfer of older patients away from rural areas may not prove beneficial as the attendant delays to therapy may negate the benefits of a higher volume center.,1
"Therefore, examining the reasons that some hospitals performing less complex cases such as appendectomy and cholecystectomy have higher mortality in geriatric patients is important; these data seem to imply that Òlow riskÓ emergency operations are not uniformly low risk at all hospitals, and can become Òhigh riskÓ operations in certain institutions.",1
The ACS CQGS should prioritize such research.,1
The overall goal should be to investigate best-practices and establish standards to allow lower volume hospitals to achieve acceptable outcomes for less complex operations in older patients.,1
The third consideration is the influence of individual surgeon volume to outcomes in geriatric EGS patients.,1
"In the elective surgical literature, much has been written about the value of both hospital volume(45-51) and surgeon volume(51-53); these relationships continue to be explored, clarified, and researched today.",1
"Unlike elective general surgery, where patients can choose their surgeon ahead of an operation, this is rare in unplanned non-elective surgical situations.",1
"Therefore, akin to the exceedingly safe field of anesthesia, the field of general surgery should strive to make EGS operations in older patients safe regardless of individual surgeon experience or volume.",1
It is justified not to investigate the individual surgeon level in a setting where a patient cannot choose their individual surgeon; to do so would be incongruent with the real-world setting of emergency surgical care.,1
"Additionally, given the limitations of the SID HCUP datasets, information on individual surgeons was not available.",1
The current study has several limitations.,1
"First, it employed the use of a retrospective administrative dataset, so the results should be interpreted in that context.",1
"For example, information was not available on cause of death or type of anesthesia used during the operation.",1
"Second, the ability to risk-adjust the data did not include physiologic parameters (such as heart rate or blood pressure) or geriatric-specific characteristics (such as frailty or functional independence) due to limitation of the SID HCUP data; the present study was additionally unable to assess involvement of geriatricians in post-operative care as well as do not resuscitate (DNR) status in the perioperative period.",1
"Third, an ÒemergencyÓ patient is a construct of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and the current study, and generalizing to all older patients requiring an urgent/emergency operation may not be valid.",1
"Fourth, due to the nature of the California SID database, the current study could only evaluate in-hospital mortality.",1
"Because variations in timing of patient discharge across hospitals can influence rates of in-hospital mortality, 30-day and 90-day mortality outcomes are considered more accurate metrics.",1
"Fifth, the data are from the state of California beginning eight years ago, and generalizations to a national level and current practice patterns may not be valid.",1
"And lastly, the hospital volume-thresholds defined herein are a construct of the study itself.",1
"While the study defined the benchmark calculation a priori, there may be other potential methodologies to define a volume-threshold.",1
"Across the spectrum of EGS, survival rates for geriatric patients were associated with significant improvement when emergency operations were performed at hospitals with higher emergency geriatric operative volumes.",1
"Operative volume for older EGS patients therefore seems to be a key quality indicator and determinant of survival, as well as a principle driver of variation in EGS hospital performance.",1
"To lessen the negative impact of the wide variation in survival rates at lower volume hospitals, geriatric patients may benefit from a formal system of emergency surgical care that consolidates operative emergencies to higher volume accredited surgery centers, as defined by the volume-threshold benchmark.",1
Further investigation needs to be conducted to define and validate other important determinants of morbidity and mortality in geriatric patients undergoing surgical emergencies.,1
"Blood vessels serve as intermediate conduits for the extension of sympathetic axons towards target tissues, while also acting as crucial targets for their homeostatic processes encompassing the regulation of temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen availability.",1
How sympathetic axons innervate not only blood vessels but also a wide array of target tissues is not clear.,1
"Here we show that in embryonic skin, after the establishment of co-branching between sensory nerves and blood vessels, sympathetic axons invade the skin alongside these sensory nerves and extend their branches towards these blood vessels covered by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).",1
Our mosaic labeling technique for sympathetic axons shows that collateral branching predominantly mediates the innervation of VSMC-covered blood vessels by sympathetic axons.,1
"The expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), previously known to induce collateral axon branching in culture, can be detected in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-covered blood vessels, as well as sensory nerves.",1
"Indeed, VSMC-specific Ngf knockout leads to a significant decrease of collateral branching of sympathetic axons innervating VSMC-covered blood vessels.",1
These data suggest that VSMC-derived NGF serves as an inductive signal for collateral branching of sympathetic axons innervating blood vessels in the embryonic skin.,1
The vertebrate sympathetic nervous system is an essential series of reactionary and reciprocal processes that mediate physiological actions involved in the regulation of homeostasis.,1
"These include the control of body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose released from the liver, and the dilation of lung bronchioles achieved through the relaxation of airway smooth muscle (Goldstein, 2013).",1
The proper regulation of homeostatic processes by the sympathetic nervous system is contingent upon the appropriate innervation of various tissues during development.,1
Sympathetic neurons originate from sympathetic ganglia (SG) and extend their axons along blood vessels over considerable distances to establish connections with various tissue targets.,1
"Impaired sympathetic innervation and its dysfunction are associated with various cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and hypotension (Scott-Solomon et al., 2021).",1
"In mice, the deletion of the homeobox transcription factor Phox2b results in the failure of proper formation and subsequent degeneration of all autonomic ganglia (Pattyn et al., 1999).",1
This indicates the critical role of Phox2B in mediating sympathetic development.,1
"Indeed, Phox2b homozygous mutant embryos lack autonomic innervation to the heart and die in utero (Mokshagundam et al., 2021; Nam et al., 2013).",1
"While sympathetic axons innervate various tissue targets, including blood vessels, the mechanisms that regulate tissue-specific innervation are not yet completely understood.",1
"Previous studies demonstrated that artemin, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), nerve growth factor (NGF), and endothelin-3 (ET-3) are expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of blood vessels and stimulate sympathetic axon extension along blood vessels (Honma et al., 2002; Kuruvilla et al., 2004; Makita et al., 2008; Nam et al., 2013), while NGF is critical for controlling sympathetic innervation of final tissue targets (Glebova and Ginty, 2004; Shelton and Reichardt, 1984).",1
Blood vessels serve not only as intermediate pathways that guide sympathetic axons towards their final targets but also represent targets for sympathetic innervation themselves.,1
"Indeed, after birth in mice, VSMC-derived netrin-1 is responsible for mediating arterial innervation in both mesenteric and skin vasculature (Brunet et al., 2014).",1
"However, the precise patterns and timing of sympathetic axon innervation to blood vessels, as well as the persistence of some axons along blood vessels towards their final targets, are still unclear.",1
"Furthermore, the mechanisms governing the process of sympathetic innervation to blood vessels during development remain incompletely understood.",1
"To investigate the precise patterns and timing of sympathetic axon innervation to blood vessels, we employed a mouse embryonic limb skin vasculature model.",1
"We have previously demonstrated that in the embryonic limb skin, sensory nerves determine the pattern of large-diameter blood vessel branching, with VSMC coverage of these blood vessels observed by embryonic day (E) 15.5 (Li et al., 2013; Mukouyama et al., 2005, 2002).",1
"On one hand, Neurogenin1/Neurogenin2 (Ngn1/Ngn2) double homozygous mutants, lacking peripheral sensory nerves, demonstrate a pronounced absence of peripheral nerves and defective blood vessel branching in the limb skin at E15.5 (Mukouyama et al., 2002).",1
"On the other hand, Phox2b homozygous mutants, lacking peripheral autonomic nerves, exhibit the appropriate co-branching of peripheral nerves and blood vessels in the limb skin (Mukouyama et al., 2002).",1
"Together, these findings strongly suggest that sensory nerves, rather than sympathetic nerves, control blood vessel branching to form the co-branching of peripheral nerves and blood vessels in the limb skin.",1
"In this study, our time-course analysis with different embryonic stages in mice (E13.5-E18.5) has revealed that following the establishment of co-branching between sensory nerves and blood vessels, sympathetic axons invade the skin alongside sensory nerves, and subsequently they extend their branches towards these blood vessels.",1
"Our mosaic labeling technique for sympathetic axons has revealed that collateral branching, in which daughter branches sprout from the main nerve, predominantly mediates the innervation of blood vessels by sympathetic axons.",1
"As NGF is recognized for its role in promoting collateral branching in vitro (Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017; Ketschek et al., 2015) and regulating final target innervation in vivo (Kuruvilla et al., 2004), our genetic studies in mice with VSMC-specific Ngf knockout unequivocally illustrate the crucial role of NGF derived from VSMCs in facilitating collateral branching of sympathetic axons within blood vessels.",1
"This data suggests that the expression of NGF in VSMCs is important to induce the formation of sympathetic collateral branching, specifically for their innervation of blood vessels in the embryonic skin.",1
"Sympathetic axons extend their branches towards blood vessels, following the establishment of co-branching between sensory nerves and blood vessels.",1
We performed whole-mount immunohistochemical analysis of the dermis of the forelimb skin from embryos at different stages (Fig. 1A).,1
"Our previous studies demonstrated that by E13.5, sensory nerves invade the dermis of the limb skin, where a primary capillary plexus has formed, and by E15.5, the primary capillary plexus remodels to form medium- or large-diameter arteries covered by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which align with the pattern of sensory nerves (Li et al., 2013; Mukouyama et al., 2005, 2002).",1
"Indeed, the vessel-aligned nerves express the sensory neuron marker calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (Fig. 1B and C, arrows).",1
"In contrast, the sympathetic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is undetectable in the dermis at E13.5 (Fig.",1
1D and G) and only minimally detected at E15.5 (Fig.,1
"1E and H, open arrows).",1
"At E17.5, numerous TH+ sympathetic axons are observed along with sensory nerves (Fig.",1
"1F and I, open arrows), and certain TH+ sympathetic axons intricately extend their branches towards blood vessels (Fig.",1
"1F and I, yellow open arrows).",1
"These data clearly indicate that, after the establishment of co-branching between sensory nerves and blood vessels, sympathetic axons invade the dermis along with the pre-existing sensory nerves and extend their branches towards blood vessels.",1
"This sequential pattern of extension may signify the dependence of sympathetic axon trajectories on their association with pre-existing sensory projections (Wang et al., 2014).",1
We next proceeded to meticulously examine the temporal patterns of sympathetic axon branching towards blood vessels in the dermis of the limb skin.,1
"In contrast to the E15.5 skin, the E17.5 skin exhibits TH+ sympathetic axon branching towards _SMA+ VSMCs of both primary and secondary branched blood vessels (Fig.",1
"2A versus B, C versus D; open arrows; the box region 1 and 2 indicates primary and secondary branched blood vessels, respectively).",1
A subset of TH+ sympathetic axons project their branches towards the hair follicles (Fig.,1
"S1A-C, outlined by dashed lines).",1
"To elucidate the branching patterns of individual sympathetic axons in the dermis of the limb skin, we employed a mosaic labeling technique on sympathetic axons.",1
"This method involved utilizing tamoxifen-inducible TH-CreERT2 mice specific to sympathetic neurons (Rotolo et al., 2008), which were bred with Cre-dependent ROSA-LSL-tdTomato (Ai9) reporter mice (Madisen et al., 2010) (Fig. 2G).",1
"By administering low-dose tamoxifen injections at E10.5, individual sympathetic axons were discerned in the dermis of the limb skin from TH-CreERT2; ROSA-LSL-tdTomato embryos.",1
"Our observations revealed that the majority of sympathetic axons exhibit collateral branching, thereby extending their branches towards _SMA+ VSMC-covered primary and secondary blood vessels (Fig.",1
"2 H-M, open arrows; N).",1
"Collectively, this data indicates that collateral branching mediates sympathetic axon branching towards VSMC-covered blood vessels.",1
"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is recognized for its role in promoting axon collateral branching, both during development and in the context of nervous system repair (Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017; Diamond et al., 1987, 1992; Ketschek et al., 2015).",1
"NGF is also recognized for its role in regulating the extension of sympathetic axons towards peripheral targets, serving as a key factor that enhances nerve survival and elongation (Glebova and Ginty, 2004, 2005; Scott-Solomon et al., 2021).",1
"To address the spatial and temporal expression of NGF in the dermis of the limb skin, we analyzed NGFLacZ knock-in mice (Liu et al., 2012) and found that NGF is primarily expressed by sensory nerves at E15.5 (Fig.",1
"3A and C, arrows), whereas both sensory nerves and VSMCs exhibit NGF expression at E17.5-E18.5, when sympathetic axons project their branches towards VSMC-covered blood vessels (Fig.",1
"3B and D, arrows and arrowheads; E).",1
"This pattern of NGF expression in sensory nerves and VSMCs, along with sympathetic axon branching towards VSMC-covered blood vessels, was also observed in the dermis of the back skin at the same embryonic stages (Fig.",1
"S2A-E, arrows and arrowheads, NGF expression; S2F and G, open arrows, sympathetic axon branching).",1
"To define the NGF expression in endothelial cells (ECs) and VSMCs in the skin vasculature, we conducted fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate ECs (CD45_/Ter119_/PECAM-1+/RFP_) and VSMCs (CD45_/Ter119_/PECAM-1_/RFP+) from the limb skin of E17.5-E18.5 _SMA-CreERT2; R26R-RFP embryos.",1
"Subsequently, we analyzed Ngf mRNA expression in these cells.",1
"Although Ngf expression is detectable in both FACS-isolated ECs and VSMCs, its expression is notably more abundant in VSMCs than in ECs (Fig. 3F).",1
"Considering that NGF and its receptor TrkA signaling promotes survival and innervation of sympathetic and sensory neurons (Belliveau et al., 1997), we observed the expression of TrkA in TH+ sympathetic axons, both those innervating VSMC-covered blood vessels and those innervating hair follicles in the skin (Fig.",1
"3G-J, open arrows; Fig.",1
"S3A-D, open arrows).",1
This data suggests that VSMC-derived NGF may potentially initiate the process of collateral branching in sympathetic axons directed towards these VSMC-covered blood vessels.,1
"To address whether VSMC-derived NGF is necessary for establishing sympathetic axon branching towards blood vessels in the dermis of the limb skin, we analyzed the patterns of sympathetic axon branching in VSMC-specific Ngf conditional knockout mice (Tampakakis et al., 2021), using VSMC-specific SM22_-Cre mice (Holtwick et al., 2002) and floxed Ngf (Ngffloxl/_) mice (Muller et al., 2012) (Fig. 4A).",1
VSMC-specific Ngf conditional knockout embryos exhibit very few sympathetic axons associated with VSMC-covered primary and secondary blood vessels in the dermis of the limb skin at E17.5-E18.5 compared to control littermates (Fig.,1
"4D versus E, D_ versus E_, D_ versus E_, open arrows; F and G).",1
"In contrast, the co-branching of sensory nerve bundles and VSMC-covered blood vessels was not affected (Fig.",1
"4B versus C, arrows and arrowheads).",1
This compromised collateral branching of sympathetic axons is unlikely to result from abnormal VSMC coverage in blood vessels (Fig.,1
4H) or a reduction in sympathetic nerve bundles (Fig. 4I).,1
"Thus, VSMC-derived NGF is required for the initiation of collateral branching in sympathetic axons directed towards these VSMC-covered blood vessels.",1
"Our findings are fully consistent with the previous in vitro studies that have shown the significance of NGF's local action in promoting axon collateral branching (Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017; Ketschek et al., 2015).",1
"Our in vivo studies demonstrate that VSMC-derived NGF in blood vessels is important to induce the formation of sympathetic collateral branching, specifically for their innervation of blood vessels.",1
"Given that after birth in mice, the axon guidance molecule netrin-1 serves as a VSMC-derived secreted factor for facilitating sympathetic innervation of VSMC-covered blood vessels in the skin vasculature (Brunet et al., 2014), NGF and netrin-1 may mediate sequential steps in sympathetic innervation of blood vessels.",1
The observation of VSMCs expressing NGF during the stages when sympathetic axons extend their branches towards these VSMC-covered blood vessels poses an intriguing question about mechanisms governing the spatial and temporal expression of NGF.,1
"It is generally analogous to our previous studies demonstrating the spatiotemporal changes in NGF expression by venous and arterial VSMCs within coronary vessels, crucial for the sympathetic innervation of the heart (Nam et al., 2013).",1
"Given the precise regulation of NGF expression in a cell-type-specific manner during development, there is a need for further investigation into molecular mechanisms that govern the transcriptional regulation of the Ngf gene in VSMCs.",1
"Lastly, our in vivo studies presented here focus on the embryonic skin vasculature model, where we illustrate (1) the collateral branching of sympathetic axons towards VSMC-covered blood vessels, and (2) the critical role played by VSMC-derived NGF in inducing sympathetic axon branching to innervate these blood vessels (Fig. 5).",1
The question of whether NGF derived from VSMCs plays an essential role in inducing sympathetic axon branching to innervate VSMC-covered blood vessels in other organ vasculature remains to be addressed.,1
"Indeed, previous studies demonstrated the development of sympathetic innervation in the postnatal mesenteric vasculature model.",1
"These investigations revealed that netrin-1 functions as a VSMC-derived secreted factor, facilitating sympathetic innervation of VSMC-covered blood vessels in postnatal mesenteric vessels (Brunet et al., 2014).",1
"To explore the potential involvement of NGF derived from VSMCs in sympathetic innervation of VSMC-covered blood vessels, including mesenteric vasculature, it is essential to examine the expression of NGF in VSMC-covered vessels during developmental and postnatal stages.",1
"Moreover, it is crucial to assess the impact on sympathetic axon branching towards VSMC-covered blood vessels in various organ vasculature using VSMC-specific Ngf conditional knockouts.",1
"All animal procedures were approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with NIH research guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.",1

"Neural precursors originating in the subventricular zone (SVZ), the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, migrate several millimeters along a restricted migratory pathway, the rostral migratory stream (RMS), toward the olfactory bulb (OB), where they differentiate into interneurons and integrate into the local neuronal circuits.",1
Migration of SVZ-derived neuroblasts in the adult brain differs in many aspects from that in the embryonic period.,1
"Unlike in that period, postnatally-generated neuroblasts in the SVZ are able to divide during migration along the RMS, as well as they migrate independently of radial glia.",1
"The homophilic mode of migration, i.e., using each other to move, is typical for neuroblast movement in the RMS.",1
"In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that specifically-arranged blood vessels navigate SVZ-derived neuroblasts to the OB and provide signals which promote migration.",1
"Here we review the development of vasculature in the presumptive neurogenic region of the rodent brain during the embryonic period as well as the development of the vascular scaffold guiding neuroblast migration in the postnatal period, and the significance of blood vessel reorganization during the early postnatal period for proper migration of RMS neuroblasts in adulthood.",1
"Postnatal neurogenesis is restricted to two sites in the mammalian brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.",1
"Unlike newborn cells in the SGZ destined for the overlying granule cell layer [1], the cells arising in the SVZ have to migrate a relatively long way through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to their final destination, the olfactory bulb (OB).",1
"In the SVZ, the largest neurogenic zone of the adult brain, astrocyte-like cells which are neural stem cells (type B cells) [2] give rise upon activation to transit-amplifying cells (type C cells), which generate neuroblasts (type A cells) and glia [3,4].",1
Neuroblasts originating in the SVZ of rodents migrate tangentially in chains several millimeters along the RMS.,1
The chains of neuroblasts are surrounded by a meshwork of astrocytes.,1
"Once the neuroblasts reach the OB, they detach from the chains and migrate radially to the bulbar layers, where they differentiate into interneurons [5].",1
The migration of neuroblasts in the migratory pathway surrounded by mature tissue is a complex process.,1
The mechanism of migration of postnatally-generated neural precursors differs from that in prenatal development.,1
"In contrast to the embryonic period, SVZ-derived neuroblasts in the adult brain migrate along the RMS without the aid of radial glia processes, since the radial glia disappear and/or transform into astrocytes after birth [6].",1
"Instead, neuroblasts use each other as a physical substrate, forming chains of cells based on cell-cell contacts in a process termed homophilic migration.",1
"This type of neuroblast movement is faster than other types of migration [7,8].",1
"In addition, postnatally-generated neuroblasts are able to divide while migrating through the RMS [9,10,11], unlike in the embryonic period when only postmitotic neuroblasts migrate to the final position [12].",1
"Recently, growing body of evidence indicates that blood vessels in the adult brain play a role in guiding neuroblast migration in the RMS, as well as, providing molecular cues affecting migration.",1
"It has been shown that vasculature is a prominent feature of stem-cell niches and plays an important role in their regulation and maintenance [13,14].",1
"The vasculature of the main neurogenic regions (SGZ and SVZ) is highly organized compared to that in non-neurogenic brain areas [13,14,15,16,17,18], and is characterized by a dense network of blood vessels which provide a substrate for progenitor cells [13,14,15,19].",1
Blood vessels in the RMS serve as a migration-promoting scaffold due to their specific arrangement.,1
"It has been shown that, for the proper migration of neuroblasts in the SVZ-RMS-OB neurogenic region, what is essential is not only the establishment of vessels in the embryonic period, but also their reorganization into a migration-promoting scaffold during the early postnatal period [20,21].",1
"This review focuses on the role of blood vessels in relation to neuroblast migration in the SVZ-RMS-OB, the development and vascularization of the presumptive neurogenic region during the embryonic period, the relevance of blood vessel rearrangement in the RMS during the early postnatal development, and the function of blood vessels in neuroblast migration in the neurogenic area of the adult brain.",1
"To provide a comprehensive view of the role of blood vessels in neuroblast migration in adult RMS, it is important to address the development of the telencephalon with emphasis on the presumptive rostral migratory stream and its vascularization during the embryonic and perinatal period For more detail, the timing of developmental events for mice and rats is summarized in Table 1 and vascularization of these regions is summarized in Table 2.",1
The CNS of rodents starts to develop during the early period of embryogenesis at the end of the first third of development in the region of the dorsal midline ectoderm.,1
"First, neuroepithelial cells establish the neural plate, which subsequently transforms into the neural tube (Table 1) [22,24] in the process known as neurulation [23].",1
"During this period and later, the neural tube is composed of actively-proliferating neuroepithelial cells, which play a fundamental role in the formation of CNS tissue [45,46].",1
"The anterior part of the neural plate gives rise to the prosencephalon, which subsequently subdivides into the diencephalon and the telencephalon.",1
"The telencephalon derives from cells at the rostral margin of the neural plate [47,48].",1
"Subsequently, the developing telencephalon subdivides into ventral (subpallial) and dorsal (pallial) territories.",1
"The embryonic dorsal telencephalon can be divided into two main regions: anterior and lateral regions, which give rise to the neocortex, and posterior and medial areas, which give rise to the hippocampus, the cortical hem, and the choroid plexus.",1
"The ventral telencephalon divides into three main regions: a medial domain known as the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and two posterior and lateral regions designated as the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and the caudal ganglionic eminence (reviewed in [49,50]).",1
"generation of neurons, also known as neurogenesis, takes place by proliferative activity of neuroepithelial cells.",1
"These progenitors residing in the area of the telencephalic germinal zones give rise to various neuronal populations employing different modes of migration toward their target destinations, including the olfactory bulb (OB) [27].",1
"Different types of neurons colonize the OB in specific time-windows throughout embryonic and postnatal life (Table 1) [29,36,41].",1
"The primordium of the OB emerges in the rodent brain after the fibers of the olfactory nerve reach the anterior pole of the telencephalon (E11ÐE13; EÐembryonic day) [27,30,31,51].",1
It is assumed that the OB develops primarily from the rostral part of the ventral pallium in the murine brain [52].,1
"In this period, early neuroblasts destined for the OB differentiate into populations of mitral cells and tufted cells, expressing markers of the projection neurons such as Tbr-1, Id-2, Reelin, neurotensin, and neuropilin [33,40] and migrate radially along the basal processes of the radial glial cells toward the OB intermediate zone [33,34].",1
It seems that the populations of OB neurons originate in different places.,1
"Bayer and Altman [32] suggested that mitral cells of the main OB in rats originate in the septal/accumbal neuroepithelium and migrate toward the prospective OB, while tufted cells and the mitral cells of the accessory OB originate in the neuroepithelium of the OB primordium.",1
"The populations of OB interneurons originate from the proliferating subpallial progenitors of the LGE [32] and acquire selective migratory capacity toward the OB in the later periods of embryonic development [32,52].",1
"An in vitro study indicates that the population of neuronal cells originating in the rostral LGE migrates radially toward the piriform cortex, then the cells reorient their processes and migrate tangentially toward the prospective OB.",1
"This population does not contribute to the populations of OB interneurons, but rather to the neuronal populations expressing markers of relay neurons such as Tbr-1 [38].",1
"Moreover, OB interneurons derived from the precursors of the embryonic LGE in the later periods of development retain their restricted migratory capacity toward the OB, even if grafted into the SVZ of adult mice [53], since E14, TUJ1, or MAP2 positive neuroblasts organize themselves into chains leading from the ventral anterior tip of the lateral ventricles toward the OB ventricles.",1
Migrating neuronal cells in the RMS have bipolar morphology and express migratory markers such as NCAM or PSA-NCAM.,1
"As the development proceeds, neuronal cells in the RMS organize themselves into a dense patch (by E16), which increases in size and elongates toward the OB.",1
"Cells surrounding the patch, also termed non-patch cells, remain undifferentiated until birth, when they start to express neuronal markers.",1
"During migration in the embryonic RMS, patch cells forming its core start to express markers of GABAergic interneurons such as GAD65 or GAD67 [37].",1
"After reaching the OB, neuronal cells in the embryonic and early postnatal RMS migrate along the processes of radial glial cells [7,43] to their final position and differentiate into populations of OB interneurons such as periglomerular or granule cells [36,37,41] expressing GABA, calretinin, calbindin, GAD65, GAD67, or tyrosine hydroxylase [29,37].",1
"Astrocytes emerge in the developing RMS (in the region of the patch) of rats during the late embryonic periods (at E16) [37], however their number increases especially during the first postnatal weeks [44,54].",1
Development of the CNS from the very early beginning is inextricably linked with the formation of the vasculature in the processes of vasculogenesis.,1
"As soon as the neurulation of the rodent embryo begins, vascularization of the CNS is initiated in the mesoderm surrounding the neural tube [55] (Table 2).",1
"First, establishment of external vasculature around the developing neural tube of rodents occurs through the coalescence of endothelial cells differentiating from angioblasts into the primitive sinusoid vessels known as the perineural vascular plexus (PNVP) (Table 2) [55,56,57].",1
"PNVP formation is controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), released by the neuroepithelium, which stimulates blood vessel growth by binding to the VEGF receptors expressed on the endothelial cells [58,59].",1
"The PNVP spreads along the rostro-caudal axis of the neural tube and supplies the neuroepithelium with oxygen and nutrients [25,60,61].",1
"As development proceeds, the rostral neural tube grows and undergoes segmentation into the primary and secondary brain vesicles, giving rise to the telencephalon [22,24,27].",1
"Subsequently, internal vascularization of the telencephalon is established through the mechanisms of sprouting angiogenesis driven by the increased metabolic demands of neuronal progenitors during the onset of neurogenesis [25,60,62].",1
"Blood vessels ingress the telencephalon from the PNVP and from the basal artery, located on the floor of the basal ganglia primordium, giving rise to the periventricular vascular plexus (PVVP) (Table 2) [63,64].",1
"During the early phases of angiogenesis, blood vessels in the mouse telencephalon extend, sprout, and form new branches (E14.5ÐE16.5), while in later periods, these branches fuse together and retract (E16.5ÐE18.5) [65].",1
"Development of the PVVP in the mouse telencephalon progresses in ventral-to-dorsal direction, since the PVVP emerges first in the subpallial preoptic area, continuing toward the MGE, LGE, ventral pallium, and to the dorsal pallial regions, successively [60,63].",1
"It was found that the ventral-to-dorsal pattern of PVVP growth follows the expression pattern of the region-specific transcription factors expressed by neuronal progenitors such as Nkx2.1, Dlx1, and Dlx2 observed in the endothelium of the ventral PVVP, or Pax6 expressed by the PVVP endothelium in the dorsal telencephalon [60,63,66].",1
"The studies examining structural features and arrangement of blood vessels in the presumptive forebrain neurogenic region of mice during development revealed that blood vessels re-orient during the early embryonic stages and become more complex as development proceeds [67,68].",1
"At E14.5, radially-oriented blood vessels predominate in this region.",1
"They are short, straight, and relatively unbranched.",1
A few longer blood vessels border the RMS elbow [67].,1
"At E16, tangentially-oriented blood vessels start to appear in the presumptive RMS region [68].",1
"From E17.5 until postnatal day 1 (P1), blood vessels within the forebrain neurogenic niche undergo gradual remodeling.",1
"At E17.5, blood vessels follow the longitudinal axis of the primordial forebrain neurogenic region, with the exception of blood vessels located in the olfactory placode, which form loop-like structures.",1
"At this age, blood vessels become longer, branched, and more frequent along the borders of the RMS [67].",1
"Finally, intense vascular remodeling continues during perinatal and early postnatal ages in the forebrain neurogenic region [20,67,68].",1
"At early postnatal stages (during the first postnatal week), blood vessels become more aligned in the longitudinal direction of the RMS and parallel to each other [68].",1
"During the later postnatal stages, the blood vessels continue increasing in complexity and length [67].",1
"In the postnatal period, angiogenesis in the brain gradually attenuates.",1
"In the rat brain, angiogenesis is complete within approximately three weeks after birth [69,70].",1
"Then, proliferation of endothelial cells is markedly down-regulated and angiogenesis is linked only with vascular growth, matching the growth of the brain [71].",1
"On the other hand, endothelial cells, though relatively quiescent in the adult brain, can proliferate under pathological conditions such as hypoxia, tumor growth, or brain injury [70,72].",1
"Under physiological conditions, angiogenesis persists only in restricted areas of the adult brain with continuing neurogenesis [73,74], i.e., in the SVZ of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles and the SGZ of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.",1
"In these areas, neural stem cells and endothelial cells/capillaries are in close proximity within a so-called Òvascular nicheÓ [75,76].",1
Coordinated interactions between nervous and vascular systems have been found not only during embryogenesis but also in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain [77].,1
"Both these systems share molecular cues, which regulate their development, function, and maintenance, such as VEGF [59,78], brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [79], basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [80,81], insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [82], erythropoietin [83], angiopoietin [84,85], and others (for review see [75,77]), so that postnatal angiogenesis and neurogenesis are regulated by growth factors produced by both, endothelial cells and neurons [75].",1
"In general, blood vessels in the postnatal brain are responsible for supplying oxygen and nutrients and removing metabolic waste products.",1
"In addition, blood vessels together with astrocytes and pericytes constitute a blood-brain barrier which regulates transport of substances toward the brain by allowing the movement of vital substances but restricting the flow of harmful agents from blood to brain.",1
"In addition to common functions, blood vessels have been found to play another role in neurogenic areas of the adult brain.",1
Blood vessels are an integral component of these regions and they release cues providing a microenvironment to maintain the neural stem cell niche [86].,1
"Dividing neural precursors are in fact closely associated with blood vessels in the SGZ [74], the SVZ [13] and the RMS [68].",1
"Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that blood vessels in the SVZ-RMS-OB promote migration of neuroblasts from the SVZ to their target structure, the OB [16,17,21,87].",1
"As the regulation of migration is a critical step in the integration of new neurons into the adult neuronal circuitry, conditions for migration in the RMS, which is surrounded with mature brain tissue along its entire length, must be effectively ensured.",1
"Unlike postmitotic CNS neurons migrating along radial glial processes to the cortex of the developing brain [88,89], in the adult brain RMS, SVZ-derived neuroblasts migrate independently of radial glia.",1
"They migrate using each other via cellÐcell contacts, creating ÒchainsÓ, and this homophilic mode of cell movement is also called chain migration [44,90].",1
"The migration of neuroblasts through the RMS is affected by both chemoattractive molecules from the OB [91,92] and chemorepellent molecules from the septum and choroid plexus [93,94,95].",1
The chains of migrating neuroblasts in the RMS are enwrapped by astrocytes which separate them from the mature tissue of the brain.,1
"It was initially believed that astrocytic tubes represent a physical barrier restricting this migration, and a scaffold navigating neuroblasts toward the OB [5].",1
"However, it was subsequently observed that astrocytes do not provide continuous wrapping around the migrating neuroblasts [17,18,44].",1
"Moreover, astrocytes are not present in the RMS until the second postnatal week [54].",1
"Logically, the question arisesÑhow are the SVZ-derived neuroblasts navigated for such a distance along the migratory pathway toward the OB?",1
"Besides the astrocytic scaffold, blood vessels ÒemergedÓ as a potential candidate which could serve as a support for migrating neuroblasts.",1
"It was noticed that specifically-arranged blood vessels in the RMS are in striking contrast with the arrangement of blood vessels in the surrounding brain parenchyma [13,16,17,18].",1
The RMS in rodents is several millimeters long (approximately 5 mm in mice) [3] and is sigmoidal in shape.,1
"For the purposes of morphological analysis, the RMS is usually divided into smaller anatomical parts, however the terminology of these parts is not consistent among authors.",1
"It is possible to distinguish the following anatomical regions along the caudalÐrostral axis of the RMS: (I) the vertical arm, the segment descending from the SVZ, leading ventrally, which can be subdivided into the caudal part, also known as the anterior part of the SVZ (SVZa) and the rostral part, also known as the vertical limb or descent; (II) the elbow: the most ventral segment of the RMS, which turns rostrally; (III) the horizontal arm, also known as the horizontal limb or enter, the segment leading rostrally, the horizontal arm, also known as the horizontal limb or enter, the segment leading rostrally, entering the OB (Figure 1) [3,17,18,37].",1
"Although exact borders between the RMS regions cannot be recognized, some differences relating to blood vessels in these regions are obvious.",1
"For example, different blood vessel density in individual regions of the RMS in both, adult mice [17] and rats [18] and different arrangement of blood vessels along the caudo-rostral axis of the RMS in rats (see below) [18].",1
"Moreover, differing permeability of blood vessels has been found along the SVZ-RMS-OB axis, with highly-permeable blood vessels in the SVZ and impermeable blood vessels in the RMS/OB [13,96].",1
"Even though the reasons for these region-dependent distinctions remain unclear, one of the possible explanations could be the different developmental base of individual parts of the RMS.",1
"According to Pencea and Luskin [37], the RMS arises in advance and independently of the cortical SVZ and is derived from two sets of cells with different mitotic activities called patch and nonpatch.",1
"Although patch and nonpatch regions merge postnatally, they may originate separately under the influence of distinct intrinsic and extrinsic factors [37].",1
"The arrangement of the RMS blood vessels was first described in adult mice [16,17].",1
"According to these studies, blood vessels in adult mice precisely outline the migratory stream from its posterior (SVZ) to the most anterior (OB) regions [16], and their orientation is parallel to the RMS throughout its extent [17].",1
"According to these studies, blood vessels in adult mice precisely outline the migratory stream from its posterior (SVZ) to the most anterior (OB) regions [16], and their orientation is parallel to the RMS throughout its extent [17].",1
"In a later morphological study, we showed that this parallel arrangement of blood vessels is not applied to the whole RMS in rats [18].",1
We found clear differences in the arrangement of blood vessels between posterior and anterior regions of the RMS.,1
"In the posterior part of the rat RMS (the caudal part of the RMS vertical arm, lying under the corpus callosum), blood vessels are oriented perpendicular to the migratory pathway, or they are turned under a distinct angle, creating a spiral-shaped configuration (Figure 2A).",1
"In contrast to this, in the rest of the migratory pathway, i.e., in the rostral part of the vertical arm as well as the elbow and the horizontal arm of the RMS in adult rats, the orientation of blood vessels is parallel to the migratory stream (Figure 2A) [18].",1
"Our preliminary results comparing the pattern of the RMS blood vessels in adult mice and rats revealed that there were not so striking differences in the arrangement of blood vessels between the species, whereby even in mice, the blood vessels are not aligned parallel to the migratory pathway, at least in its most posterior part (SVZa) (Figure 2B) (unpublished data).",1
A detailed morphological study is needed to clearly show the interspecies differences in blood vessel arrangement.,1
"On the other hand, the pattern of blood vessel arrangement in the RMS of both species, mice and rats, is easily distinguishable from the rather random arrangement of blood vessels in the surrounding brain parenchyma (Figure 2A,B).",1
"Nevertheless, there are some interspecies differences in the RMS of mice and rats, which are unrelated to blood vessels.",1
These differences concern the RMS morphology and cellular composition.,1
"In parasagittal brain sections, the RMS has an ÒLÓ shape in adult rats (Figure 2A) but a ÒUÓ shape in adult mice (Figure 2B) [97].",1
A slight temporal delay can be observed in mice compared with rats regarding the glial structure assembly [44].,1
"Furthermore, interspecies differences have been found in the molecular profile of certain glial cell populations in the SVZ-RMS.",1
"In addition, the first glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells appear in the SVZ at P9 in rats and at P13 in mice [44].",1
The olfactory ventricle surrounded by the RMS and communicating with the lateral ventricle disappears at P3 in mice and at P6 in rats.,1
Neuroblasts arranged in chains appear in mice at P15 and in rats at P21 [44].,1
Such differences are probably linked with the evolutionary divergence of mice and rats.,1
"Besides the specific arrangement of blood vessels in the RMS, another characteristic is their higher density in the migratory pathway in comparison with adjacent tissue of the brain in both species, mice, and rats [17,18].",1
"Higher density of blood vessels applies to all parts of the RMS, and together with the known high density of cells in the RMS, this could logically suggest higher metabolic demand in this area.",1
"However, high blood vessel density may not be causally related to high cell density, since Whitman et al.",1
"[17] showed that the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, an area as equally cell-dense as the RMS, has a lower density of blood vessels.",1
"Recently, it has been shown that the higher density of blood vessels, as well as their specific arrangement, plays an important role in the RMS.",1
"Besides supplying nutrients, oxygen, and regulatory cues and being a part of the blood-brain barrier, another role of blood vessels in the neurogenic area of the adult brain has been proposed linked to neuroblast migration.",1
Several studies have shown that there is evident association between blood vessels and the chains of neuroblasts.,1
"These studies suggest that blood vessels together with astrocytes might serve as a physical substrate fostering neuroblast migration from the SVZ to the OB [16,17,18,87].",1
The first indication of vasculature-guided (vasophilic) neuroblast migration appeared in the study of Bovetti et al.,1
[87] and concerns the migration of neuronal precursors in the OB of mice.,1
"Other studies provided further evidence for the vasophilic mode of neuroblast migration in the RMS of adult mice [16,17].",1
Whitman et al.,1
"[17] found that approximately 50Ð85% of the length of each vessel is lined with chains of migrating neuroblasts, and this linear apposition increases along the course of the RMS.",1
"Quantitative analysis, measuring the distance of neuroblasts from blood vessels, revealed that in the RMS, around 97% of neuroblasts are located within 3 µm of the blood vessels [16].",1
"In the part of the RMS entering the OB, where neuroblasts change their mode of migration from tangential to radial, this percentage was lower because some neuroblasts detach from blood vessels [16].",1
"However, even in the granular cell layer of the OB (the final destination for the majority of new-born neurons), 45% of neuroblasts are distributed less than 3 µm from the blood vessels [87].",1
Time-lapse video imaging in acute brain slices of adult mice showed neuronal precursors migrating tangentially along the blood vessels in the RMS [16] and radially in the granular cell layer of the OB [87].,1
It was revealed that the neuroblasts migrated in a saltatory fashion along the blood vessels.,1
"This movement consisted of a migratory phase in which the neuronal cell body shifted toward the leading process, which was then followed by a stationary phase [16,87].",1
"In the RMS, the chains of migrating neuroblasts are surrounded by GFAP-expressing astrocytes.",1
It has been shown that the morphology of astrocytes in the RMS differs from that in the surrounding tissue.,1
"The astrocytes in the RMS of adult mice do not exhibit the typical stellate shape; they are rather polarized, and their branches are aligned with the path of migration [17].",1
"Similarly, in adult rats, the majority of astrocytes have their long processes aligned with the migratory pathway; however, in the caudal part of the vertical arm (overlaid by the corpus callosum), most astrocytic processes are directed toward the corpus callosum, irrespective of the direction of neuroblast migration [18].",1
"The astrocytes of the RMS line the blood vessels, and their processes interdigitate with the neuroblasts.",1
It has been found that migrating neuroblasts can actively remodel astrocytic tubes to facilitate their directed migration.,1
"The neuroblasts have the ability to remove impeding astrocytic processes by secreting a diffusible protein with repulsive activity, Slit1, whose receptor, Robo, is expressed on the RMS astrocytes [98].",1
"Astrocytes wrap the brain vasculature and usually separate neural cells from endothelial cells, contributing thus to the bloodÐbrain barrier.",1
"Intriguingly, based on electron-microscopic observations, it has been demonstrated that neuroblasts in the RMS can in some cases directly contact blood vessels without any intervening astrocytes or pericytes [17,44].",1
"Similarly in the SVZ, Tavazoie et al.",1
"[13] found that stem cells and transit-amplifying cells directly contact blood vessels at sites devoid of astrocyte endfeet, as well as pericyte coverage.",1
"Unlike the SVZ and RMS, such direct contact between neural precursor cells and endothelial cells has not been found in the OB [87].",1
"Recently, there has been a growing body of evidence concerning the vasophilic migration of neuroblasts in the RMS and the OB.",1
"However, it was still unclear whether blood vessels represent the Òpath of least resistanceÓ for neuroblasts or whether blood vessels are also a source of some migration-promoting factors.",1
"Based on tracer experiments, it was found that the bloodÐbrain barrier of the SVZ is modified and that circulating small molecules can enter the SVZ via two routes, directly from the vessels in the SVZ vascular plexus and from vessels in the choroid plexus [13,97].",1
"Neuronal precursors residing in the SVZ may, therefore, easily receive spatial cues and regulatory signals circulating in the bloodstream.",1
"Moreover, endothelial cells themselves produce diffusible signals, such as VEGF, BDNF and other factors, which can affect neuronal precursors [79,99,100,101].",1
The regulatory effect of BDNF on migration of neuroblasts in the SVZ-RMS has been shown in vitro [102].,1
"Later, the Saghatelyan group demonstrated that in the SVZ-RMS, BDNF is produced by endothelial cells of blood vessels [16].",1
"Moreover, they revealed the principle of vasophilic migration [16,103] and they showed that migrating neuroblasts control their own migration by regulating the amount of extracellular BDNF.",1
"BDNF produced by endothelial cells bound with p75NTR low-affinity receptors on neuroblasts, thus fostering the entrance of neuroblasts to the migratory phase.",1
"Then, GABA released by neuroblasts induced Ca2+-dependent expression of TrkB, high-affinity receptor for BDNF, on astrocytes.",1
"This resulted in trapping of BDNF by astrocytes, thereby regulating its availability in extracellular space, which induces entry of migrating neuroblasts to the stationary phase [16].",1
"As well as in the adult brain, vasophilic migration of neuroblasts has been observed in neonates.",1
"In neonatal and juvenile mice, besides tangential migration of neuroblasts along the RMS, radial migration of neuroblasts from the SVZ-RMS through the corpus callosum into the lower layers of the brain cortex has been observed [104].",1
"Later, it was found that these neuroblasts migrate along the blood vessels and that the vasophilic mode of radial migration toward the cortex gradually decreases and disappears around the fourth postnatal week [105].",1
"It was suggested that the decrease in vasophilic radial migration was probably due to the establishment of a glial sheath surrounding the RMS, and due to gradual decrease in the density of blood vessels in the corpus callosum [105].",1
"However, tangential vasophilic migration of SVZ-derived neuroblasts toward the OB continues even in adulthood [16,17,87].",1
"During perinatal and early postnatal developmental stages, intense vascular remodeling takes place in the forebrain neurogenic region [67,68].",1
"At early postnatal stages (during the first postnatal week), blood vessels become more aligned in the longitudinal direction of the RMS and parallel to each other [68].",1
"During later postnatal weeks, blood vessels continue increasing in complexity and length [67].",1
Mechanisms leading to the appearance and formation of a migration-promoting vasculature scaffold during early developmental stages were examined by Bozoyan et al. [20].,1
"During early postnatal stages, the RMS contains two distinct sub-regions, the border and the core, with different characteristics [20].",1
"Overall density of blood vessels in the RMS increases during postnatal development, with consistently more parallel blood vessels at the border of the RMS than in the core.",1
"Other differences have been found between the borders and the core of the RMS: fewer branched blood vessels in the borders than in the core; the presence of proliferating and migrating endothelial cells during early developmental stages restricted to the outer borders of the RMS, the place where the first parallel blood vessels appear.",1
"Thus, it has been suggested that the migration-promoting vasculature scaffold is first laid down on the borders of the RMS [20].",1
"As the brain grows, the RMS gradually becomes longer and thinner, the center of the RMS collapses, and the RMS borders approach each other [20].",1
"Although the RMS blood vessels are laid down during early development [67], their reorganization occurs postnatally [20] and this vascular rearrangement seems to be crucial for neurogenic processes in the SVZ-RMS-OB.",1
"By blocking VEGF signaling during early developmental stages, Licht et al.",1
"[106] induced a collapse of the RMS vascular network, which resulted in complete failure of the migration of newborn neuronal precursors from the SVZ toward the OB and thus piling up of neuronal precursors amidst the RMS and their subsequent apoptosis.",1
"In contrast, when VEGF signaling was blocked in the adult brain, no excessive endothelial or neuronal cell death was noted, and nor was any reduction seen in the number of neuronal precursors reaching the OB [106].",1
"Later, it was shown that during the early postnatal period, VEGF is produced by astrocytes, which first emerge on the outer borders of the migratory stream and this astrocyte-derived VEGF plays a key role in the development and structural rearrangement of the vasculature scaffold [20].",1
"When the VEGF expression was downregulated in vivo, specifically in the astrocytes of the developing RMS, the development of the vascular scaffold was affected and this consequently led to alteration of the neuronal migration, accumulation of neuronal precursors in the RMS, and decrease in the number of newborn neurons arriving at the OB [20].",1
"In our laboratory, we obtained similar results when angiogenesis was inhibited during the early postnatal period [21].",1
"Administration of endostatin, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis which interferes with VEGFR-2, prevented the effect of VEGF on angiogenesis and resulted in the disruption of blood vessel reorganization into a proper vascular scaffold [21].",1
This failure of vascular rearrangement caused disruption of the mode and direction of neuroblast migration.,1
"Chain migration failed, and some neuroblasts moved individually and migrated out of the RMS.",1
"The number of proliferating cells in the RMS increased, probably due to their accumulation caused by disrupted neuroblast migration.",1
"These effects of angiogenesis inhibition were more evident shortly after the inhibition, although the effects remained noticeable even after a longer time [21].",1
"Taken together, this suggests that the reorganization of blood vessels in the RMS and formation of a vascular scaffold during the early postnatal period is crucial for the regular course of postnatal neurogenesis in the SVZ-RMS-OB system.",1
"Neurogenesis in the adult brain attracts the attention of researchers all over the world because there are prospects for the use of newly-generated cells in treating disorders associated with neuron loss, such as brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, or stroke.",1
"Under physiological conditions, newborn cells originating in the SVZ are destined for the OB.",1
"In addition, under pathological conditions, neuronal precursors are able to migrate out of the neurogenic region of the SVZ toward the site of ischemia [72,107].",1
"Adult neurogenesis is a complex process, which includes proliferation, migration, differentiation, and integration of newborn cells into functional neuronal circuits.",1
Each of these processes is regulated by multiple factors on cellular and molecular levels.,1
"Although blood vessels have been known for many years to be a critical component of neurogenic niches [13,14,74,76], it has only recently been revealed that the vasculature in the SVZ-RMS-OB also plays a role in the regulation of neuroblast migration [16,17,87].",1
"Blood vessels in the adult neurogenic region serve as a scaffold along which neuroblasts migrate (Figure 3), similar to processes of radial glial cells during the embryonic period.",1
"In addition, endothelial cells of blood vessels produce migration-promoting cues [16].",1
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common chronic complications of diabetics which causes nerve damage and muscle strength decrease in patients.,1
This in turn results in imbalance leading to the diabetic patients' daily activity disparity.,1
The present investigation was conducted to specifically study the effects of combined training (resistance-aerobic) on serum kinesin-1 and physical function in type 2 diabetes patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.,1
24 diabetic neuropathic females were randomly to be selected out and divided into two experimental and control groups.,1
The experimental group received resistance-aerobic training for 3 sessions during eight weeks.,1
"The exercise training included resistance exercises with 2-3 sets, 6-7 exercise stations, 8-12 repetitions (reps), and 3-5 minutes of rest in between the exercises, and the aerobic exercises contained 50-65% of heart rate reserve (HRR) for 3 minutes with 30 seconds of rest interval between sets and 5-10 repetitions.",1
"Results show that the serum kinesin-1 level and aerobic endurance declined after eight weeks of combined (resistance-aerobic) exercise training, but this decrease was not significant.",1
"The upper body strength increased but it was not significant, while the lower body showed a significant strength increase.",1
"With regard to the progressive nature of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, it seems that even the little changes resulting from the combined exercise training can be useful.",1
"Nevertheless, more research is required in this area.",1
The diabetic peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications resulting from diabetes.,1
"This complication emerges with such symptoms in patients as severe pain, increase in injury or wound danger and amputation, sense loss or decrease, tingling sensation in hands or feet, menopausal hot flashes, instability increase and balance, and performance disorder [1].",1
"The factors affecting the diabetic peripheral neuropathic pathogens are the hyperglycemia, nitrogen and oxidative stress, mitochondrial function disorder, polyol pathway activation, advanced glycation end product (AGE) increase, and irritation symptom increase [2, 3] which result in destruction of neurons and axons in sensory and motor nerves.",1
"Nerve damage in the diabetic peripheral neuropathy follows a specific destructive pattern in such a way that first sensory nerves and then motor ones are involved, and this involvement appears as dying-back.",1
It means that the lower axons die before the complete destruction of the nervous system (nerve tree) [4].,1
It seems that the dying-back pattern results from a disorder or progression in the production of proteins and necessary matters needed for axons.,1
This pattern is more seen in longer axons [4].,1
The large distance of axons from the cellular body causes the materials required for its preserving and functioning to get transported more quickly by the axonal transport system.,1
"This system includes microtubules and motor kinesin and dynein proteins [5, 6].",1
Kinesin-1 with the energy resulting from ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) hydrolysis moves over the microtubules and is responsible for the movement of many of cell shipments.,1
The connection of cell shipments to kinesin-1 is established through two kinesin light chains (KLC) [7].,1
KLC1 is responsible for connecting intercellular shipments such as cellular mitochondria and proteins [8] and plays a major role in axonal (nerve) transport [9].,1
The disorder in the axonal transport system results in the destruction of motor units and neurogenic muscular atrophy [10].,1
"It seems that with a person's chronic affliction to diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its major increase, the motor axons are more subject to destruction and at last results in more muscular tissue death [11].",1
"Neurogenic muscular atrophy declines patients' muscular strength, speed, and endurance and is along with neural fatigue leading to the reduction of their potential performance [12, 13].",1
"In fact, it seems that losing muscular strength in the lower body is the major cause of walking imbalance and disorders in the diabetic peripheral neuropathic patients.",1
This increases the danger of falling down [13].,1
"The purpose of treating the diabetic peripheral neuropathy is to prevent the advancement of neuropathic symptoms and neural function disorders and its decadence, but more importantly is to expand the rebuilding of immature fiber degeneration [14].",1
"Although regular physical exercise most probably cannot completely divert the peripheral neuropathic symptoms, it can prevent from more muscular strength loss and flexibility decline [15]; moreover, it can relieve the diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain [16] and improves the neural function [15, 17].",1
"Studies indicate that combined resistance and aerobic exercise training remarkably reduces neuropathic symptoms and pain, increases muscular fiber [15], and improves walking strength and balance [18, 19].",1
It also improves skin neural density [19] and reduces general and physical fatigue [20].,1
"Based on our knowledge, the effect of combined resistance and aerobic exercise training on serum kinesin in the diabetic peripheral neuropathic patients has not been investigated in studies so far, the present study was conducted to show whether it can affect the serum KLC1 variations, aerobic resistance, and upper and lower body strength.",1
"This trial designed a parallel group including allocation ratio 1_:_1 with a pretest and posttest, carried out in Sabzevar, Iran.",1
"After calling for subjects' entering the research project, 24 females were randomly (Simple) selected and then randomly divided into two equal groups: control and experimental (N = 12).",1
"For randomization, we use flipping a coin for the two treatment groups (control versus experimental); the side of the coin (i.e., heads-control and tails-experimental) determines the assignment of each subject.",1
"The approval of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (by applying the Michigan Questionnaire and Monofilament 10-Point Test), the age range of 45-65 years, the subjects' ability to do resistance and aerobic exercises, and the females' menopause were the inclusion criteria for this study.",1
"The exclusion criteria for the study were such problems as amputation, sole injury, severe retinopathy, dialysis and neuropathy, upper body neuropathy or arthritis that could help reduce and/or limit the pain, the existence of imbalance factors except for neuropathy, subjects' not attending the initial and final tests and sample taking, and absenting from the exercise for more than 3 sessions.",1
"Due to their having some of the criteria, two of the subjects in the experimental group had to leave the study before it was terminated.",1
"Also, patients were asked to complete forms ÒPAR-Q+Ó (Annex 1) and ÒInformed Consent Form TemplateÓ (Annex 2) before the protocol started.",1
Note: this research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences with number IR.MEDSAB.REC.1396.3.,1
The training program was implemented for 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks.,1
"In the beginning of each session of exercise, the subjects warmed up for 15 minutes and then did the resistance exercises.",1
"Having done the resistance exercises, they took a rest of 3-5 minutes and started doing aerobic exercises and cooled off after they exercised for 10-15 minutes.",1
Warm up exercises contained walking for 5 minutes and doing the training protocol strength exercises without any load for 10 minutes.,1
Cooling down consisted of 5 minutes for walking and 5-10 minutes for stretching exercises.,1
"The resistance training included chest press, wide-grip lat pulldown, barbell curl, lying triceps press, leg extension, lying leg curls, sit-up, and push-up using bodybuilding equipment.",1
"The movements started with the stations that involved bigger muscles, the movements such as leg extension, and then moved to and finished in the stations that activated the smaller muscles like barbell curl.",1
"The training intensity was managed in such a way that the subjects could do each movement for 8-12 times repetitively; in case a subject managed to carry out each exercise movement for 12 times in two sessions in a row, the used weight increased in the next session.",1
The exercises were carried out in two sets for the first four weeks and after the fifth week all the movements were followed in three sets to the end of the program.,1
The number of stations was 6 until the seventh week and in the eighth week it was increased to 7.,1
The number of repetitions in the whole period of the exercise was fixed and unchangeable and it was 8-12 reps.,1
The rest time between the sets was one minute and between the stations it was two minutes.,1
The aerobic training included the interval running with 3-minute repetitions and a rest time of 30 seconds.,1
The intensity of aerobic training started with 50% of heart rate reserve (HRR) [21] in the first week and was increased to 65% in the eighth week.,1
The number of repetitions also started with 5 in the first week and was terminated with 10 in the eighth week.,1
"To test the subjects' aerobic resistance, upper body (trunk) and lower body strength, the 6-minute walking test, the 30-second bicep curl test, and Rikli and Jones Chair Stand Test were administered [22].",1
The blood samples (5cc) were taken from the patients' veins 24 hours before and 48 hours after the training program after a 12-hour night fasting.,1
The samples were poured in test tubes without anticoagulant agent.,1
"To prepare the blood serum, the samples were kept in room temperature for 10 minutes, their clot being removed, and then were centrifuged at 3000_rpm for 20 minutes.",1
The samples were frozen at -20¡C.,1
The KLC1 serum level was measured by using the human ELIZA kit with a sensitivity level of 2.44_ng/ml and CV of 5% (EASTBIOPHARM-China).,1
"To analyze the data, the SPSS-23 was used.",1
"To calculate the standard deviation and the mean, the descriptive statistics was applied.",1
"After getting assured about the normality of the data by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Normality Test and analysis of homogeneity variances using the Levene's Test, repeated measures ANOVA was used for the analysis of the data.",1
The data analysis in Table 1 shows that the anthropometric data of the training and control groups did not significantly differ in the pretest (P < 0.05).,1
"The results indicate that the KLC1 serum levels did not change significantly after eight weeks in both groups (P > 0.05); furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two groups in their serum levels of KLC1 (P > 0.05), but effect size data shows that training could moderately effect on KLC1 levels.",1
"The aerobic endurance difference both in the treatment group and in the control group after eight weeks was not significant (P > 0.05); however, the comparison between the two levels of aerobic endurance of both groups showed that after eight weeks the aerobic endurance in the control group significantly decreased (P = 0.008), and effect size data shows that training could moderately effect on aerobic endurance.",1
"The upper body strength level both within and between groups did not significantly vary (P > 0.05) after eight weeks; nevertheless, the lower body strength in training group significantly increased after eight weeks (P = 0.001), and data shows that the effect size of training on lower body strength is strong.",1
"The diabetic peripheral neuropathy causes structural variations in the peripheral neurons [23], and neural transport system that functions with kinesin and dynein motor proteins gets functionally impaired [6].",1
"Because of the destruction of neurons, proteins and other materials of the damaged neurons enter the blood and are disposed [24].",1
"Various studies indicate that resistance and aerobic training helps purge the diabetic peripheral neuropathic complications [15, 25, 26].",1
"However, the findings of the present study proved that the combined resistance-aerobic training did not show a significant difference in the KLC1 serum level after eight weeks [27].",1
"To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first research work that investigated the KLC1 variations in the subjects afflicted with diabetic neuropathy.",1
"In some similar works carried out on animals, the kinesin variation in their nervous system was investigated. ",1
"As Golbar et al. [28] and Rahmati et al. (2013) indicated, the endurance training significantly increased the kinesin level and, in turn, its mRNA in the sciatic nerves of the healthy rats' treatment group, compared with that of the healthy rats control group; however, in the diabetic treatment group the kinesin and, in turn, its mRNA levels declined thanks to the training, compared with those of the diabetic control group.",1
These studies indicated that the KLC1 level in the diabetic control group is more than that of the training-diabetic group and healthy control and training groups where the findings are in line with the findings of the study conducted by Baptista et al. [29] that showed an increase expression of Hippocampus KLC-1 in rats [29].,1
The constant increase of kinesin-1 content in the sciatic nerves of the diabetic neuropathic rats is probably because of dying-back of the neurons in neuropathy and the activation of compensating mechanism.,1
"However, in response to the logical and effective exercise activities, neurons get activated and balance this content helping it reach a normal level [28, 29].",1
"Further, in line with these findings, some other research works are suggestive of the same decrease in the level of kinesin or disorder in that content.",1
"For example, in rats afflicted with parkinsonism [30, 31] and in patients afflicted with ALS [32] and Alzheimer's disease, the content of kinesin reduces [33]; however, the KLC1 level in patients with breast cancer was witnessed to be remarkably increasing [34].",1
"It is worth mentioning that in the present study, it was observed that the dose of medicine used by the subjects varied in such a way that the drug dose in the control group increased, while in the training group it decreased.",1
"This can justify the decrease of KLC1 serum level in the control group and the insignificance of the training group's KLC1 serum level variation, and this is consistent with the effect size findings in Table 2.",1
"The results of the present study showed that aerobic endurance reduced in both groups, but the reduction level in the training group was less than that of the control group.",1
It seems that the training program had some benefit on aerobic endurance.,1
It seems that the findings of the present research are in line with those of Kluding et al.,1
[15] where they found that regular physical exercise could not reverse the peripheral neuropathic symptoms but could prevent the progression or advancement of the disease [15].,1
"The findings of the current work also showed that combined resistance-aerobic training could not completely stop the diabetic peripheral neuropathic patients' walking disorders, but they could reduce the progression or advancement pace up to 1/5.",1
"In the investigation of other studies, it can be observed that aerobic training [35] and combined (aerobic-resistance) ones [36] increased the duration of the diabetic patients' walking where the findings differ from those of the present study.",1
This difference may be due to the subjects' individual differences in that the subjects of these two researches were not afflicted with diabetic neuropathy.,1
Two other research works also investigated the effects of aerobic training on the diabetic neuropathic patients whose results were contradictory.,1
Another point in focus is that while the findings of the study conducted by Morrison et al.,1
"[37] showed a significant improvement in the patients' walking, response time, balance indices, and dynamic position, those of the study carried out by Kruse et al.",1
(2010) showed that the combined resistance-aerobic training brought about no improvement in the balance and endurance of the patients' lower body [37].,1
This incongruity might be due to the intensity and type of the exercise protocol.,1
Diabetic neuropathy results in disorders in the nervous transport system and finally in muscular neurogenic atrophy [10].,1
"Muscular atrophy causes the muscular strength, speed, and endurance to decline [12, 13].",1
"In the present study, the trunk strength increase in the treatment group was insignificant, but in the control group it declined.",1
"The decline in the control group subjects' muscular strength of their trunk might be due to the progressing neuropathy; however, this was not the same as in the treatment group: the combined training not only prevented from the progression of the disease, but also helped increase the patients' trunk muscular strength compared with its status in the pretest.",1
"In line with the findings of the present study, some other research works showed a congruence of their findings.",1
They indicate that the aerobic-resistance exercises increase muscular strength and endurance [38Ð41].,1
The results of the present study also showed that lower body strength significantly increased in the combined training group but decreased in the control group.,1
"These findings, along with those of the other studies, show that aerobic and resistance training can potentially enhance the type 2 diabetic patients' muscular strength [42Ð44] and that of the patients afflicted with diabetic neuropathy [45Ð47].",1
"Here, one question is raised: while experiencing a significant increase in the lower body strength, why cannot we observe any improvement in aerobic endurance?",1
"To answer this question, it can be said that in order to walk and keep balanced, an individual, in addition to his muscular strength [48], needs to enjoy such factors as quick response time, spatial perception, body sense feedbacks, visual information [49], cognitive function, and behavioral-cognitive understanding factors [50].",1
Any disorder in any of them results in losing the balance and falling down [51].,1
The age attribute increase might have had a significant effect on each issue stated above and might have caused the balance loss.,1
"In regard to the progressive nature of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and the limited time of the combined aerobic and resistance treatment, it seems that the little variations having occurred in KLC-1 serum, aerobic endurance, and trunk strength can be positively taken and evaluated, and in spite of the fact that these variations are not statistically significant, it can be predicted that probably longer periods of these trainings can bring about effective results.",1
"Regarding the fact that the lower body strength increase is significant, it can be concluded that the combined aerobic-resistance training has had a significant effect on the lower body strengthening factors, and it is felt that more research is required to be conducted in this field.",1
Diabetic gastroenteropathy frequently causes debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms.,1
Previous uncontrolled studies have shown that transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) may improve gastrointestinal symptoms.,1
"To investigate the effect of cervical tVNS in individuals with diabetes suffering from autonomic neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms, we conducted a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind (participants and investigators were blinded to the allocated treatment) study.",1
"This study included adults (aged 20Ð86) with type 1 or 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal symptoms and autonomic neuropathy recruited from three Steno Diabetes Centres in Denmark.",1
Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive active or sham stimulation.,1
Active cervical tVNS or sham stimulation was self-administered over two successive study periods: 1 week of four daily stimulations and 8 weeks of two daily stimulations.,1
The primary outcome measures were gastrointestinal symptom changes as measured using the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS).,1
Secondary outcomes included gastrointestinal transit times and cardiovascular autonomic function.,1
"Sixty-eight participants were randomised to the active group, while 77 were randomised to the sham group.",1
"Sixty-three in the active and 68 in the sham group remained for analysis in study period 1, while 62 in each group were analysed in study period 2.",1
"In study period 1, active and sham tVNS resulted in similar symptom reductions (GCSI: _0.26 ± 0.64 vs _0.17 ± 0.62, p=0.44; GSRS: _0.35 ± 0.62 vs _0.32 ± 0.59, p=0.77; mean ± SD).",1
"In study period 2, active stimulation also caused a mean symptom decrease that was comparable to that observed after sham stimulation (GCSI: _0.47 ± 0.78 vs _0.33 ± 0.75, p=0.34; GSRS: _0.46 ± 0.90 vs _0.35 ± 0.79, p=0.50).",1
"Gastric emptying time was increased in the active group compared with sham (23 min vs _19 min, p=0.04).",1
Segmental intestinal transit times and cardiovascular autonomic measurements did not differ between treatment groups (all p>0.05).,1
The tVNS was well-tolerated.,1
"Cervical tVNS, compared with sham stimulation, does not improve gastrointestinal symptoms among individuals with diabetes and autonomic neuropathy.",1
"Diabetic gastroenteropathy affects multiple nerves, including those of the enteric nervous system and the vagal nerves, which modulate gastrointestinal function, causing widespread secretory and motor disturbances [1].",1
"Thus, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, malnutrition, unpredictable drug absorption and poor glycaemic control may occur, significantly reducing the quality of life and increasing the disease burden [2, 3].",1
"Progression of the underlying autonomic neuropathy may be reduced by multifactorial intervention [4], but gastrointestinal symptoms still require symptomatic management.",1
"Unfortunately, the management options have several limitations.",1
"Pharmacological therapies, e.g.",1
"prokinetic drugs, often have limited efficacy and can lead to severe side effects [5].",1
"Surgery may be required in some individuals and may involve gastric electrical stimulation [6, 7].",1
"The electrical stimulation improves nausea and vomiting in individuals with severe gastroparesis, probably by modulating the afferent vagal nerves without affecting gastric emptying [6, 8].",1
"However, the procedures are invasive, carry a risk of complications, and are often inefficacious.",1
"Consequently, there is an unmet need for effective and non-invasive treatment modalities.",1
"A potential target for future treatment is the vagal nerve, as its bidirectional signalling between the brain and the gastrointestinal system is essential for maintaining normal gastrointestinal function by modulating gastric tone etc. [9, 10].",1
"In animal studies, transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) enhances gastrointestinal motility [11].",1
"Human studies have also demonstrated the ability of tVNS to modulate gastric motility, increase heart rate variability and activate vagal-related areas in the brain [12Ð14].",1
"tVNS is a non-invasive and user-friendly treatment that primarily activates the afferent vagal nerve fibres, similar to the presumed mechanism of invasive gastric electrical stimulation [15].",1
"Various stimulation devices are available, mainly targeting the auricular or cervical part of the vagal nerve.",1
"The cervical tVNS device gammaCore (electroCore, USA) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and CE-marked for treating migraine and cluster headaches [16].",1
"Two smaller observational studies have indicated that cervical tVNS diminishes gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with gastroparesis [17, 18].",1
"However, randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled studies are lacking, and the symptom improvement seen in previous studies may be a placebo effect.",1
"Diabetic gastroenteropathy affects the entire gastrointestinal tract, resulting in diverse symptoms extending beyond the stomach [19, 20].",1
"Treatments are most often prescribed based on these clinical symptoms, as measures such as gastric emptying and segmental transit time are unsuitable for assessing treatment efficacy due to temporal variations and poor correlation with symptom severity [21].",1
We hypothesised that cervical tVNS improves gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with diabetes and autonomic neuropathy.,1
The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of cervical tVNS on gastrointestinal symptoms.,1
"The secondary aims were to further examine the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms, gastrointestinal transit times and autonomic function.",1
"An investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled, multicentre trial exploring the effects of cervical tVNS on gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with diabetes was conducted across three Steno Diabetes Centers in Denmark (North Denmark, Copenhagen and Aarhus).",1
The participants were current patients or contacted the study personnel after reading about the study through social media or patient forums.,1
"Thus, the study included participants from both primary care and tertiary centres, covering a wide age range (20Ð86 years), indicating that the sample is representative of individuals with diabetes who experience gastrointestinal symptoms.",1
"Ethnicity and sex were self-reported, and sex assigned at birth was used, both reflecting the overall population composition in Denmark, with white ethnicity and female sex being slightly overrepresented.",1
"Eligible participants were >18 years old, and had a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes confirmed at least 1 year before enrolment.",1
The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and verified autonomic neuropathy were required for participation.,1
A weighted composite symptom cut-off score of 2.3 was used to ensure a significant symptom severity before inclusion.,1
This cut-off was based on the score for the mean gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) in four cohorts of healthy individuals plus 1 SD (0.89) and the score for the mean gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) in three cohorts of healthy individuals plus 2 SD (1.53) [22].,1
"The score was further weighted (GCSI _1.33 and GSRS _0.8) to ensure equal questionnaire contribution [23, 24].",1
"Diabetic autonomic neuropathy was confirmed through either (1) at least one abnormal autonomic cardiovascular reflex test assessed using the VAGUS device (Medicus Engineering, Denmark) [25]; (2) a decreased sudomotor response assessed using the SUDOSCAN device (Impeto Medical, USA) with electrochemical chloride conductance cut-offs for inclusion at 50 _S for hands and 70 _S for feet [26, 27]; or (3) a score above 16 on the validated composite autonomic symptoms score (COMPASS31) [28].",1
Participants were required to maintain stable medication usage for 3 months before and during the study.,1
The presence of any known concurrent gastrointestinal disease alongside diabetic gastroenteropathy led to exclusion.,1
The complete list of exclusion criteria is available in the study protocol [22].,1
"Baseline demographic information on height, weight, and smoking status were self-reported.",1
"The study was approved by the North Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics (N-20190020) and the Danish Medicines Agency (CIV-19-07-029105), and supervised by the independent Danish Good Clinical Practice unit, ensuring data accuracy and credibility.",1
The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04143269).,1
All participants gave written informed consent.,1
"The study intervention was tVNS delivered using the self-administered handheld gammaCore device, stimulating the cervical part of the vagal nerve using a low-voltage electrical signal [16].",1
The sham device was identical to the active device but solely generated a humming sound.,1
"The study was structured in two parallel treatment groups, with participants staying in their assigned randomisation.",1
"An independent, unblinded investigator taught the participants to use the device properly and oversaw the first stimulation in each study period.",1
The participants were given a diary to document every stimulation in prespecified time intervals.,1
"The device was placed anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lateral to the trachea and above the carotid artery pulsation.",1
"The participants were instructed to adjust the intensity in arbitrary units from 1 to 40, using the highest tolerable but non-painful level.",1
The tVNS was administered for 120 s bilaterally four times daily for 1 week in study period 1 and twice daily for 8 weeks in study period 2.,1
The study periods were separated by a 2-week wash-out period [22].,1
Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive active or sham stimulation in blocks of 8 (sealedenvelope.com).,1
Each site received centrally allocated gammaCore and sham devices with unique anonymised numbers.,1
Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using two validated questionnaires.,1
The patient assessment of upper gastrointestinal symptom severity index consists of 20 items with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (very severe symptoms) [29].,1
"The GCSI comprises nine of these questions, focusing on upper gastrointestinal symptoms divided into three categories: nausea/vomiting, bloating and postprandial fullness [23].",1
The GSRS was used to detect lower gastrointestinal symptoms.,1
"It comprises 15 items with scores of 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (very severe discomfort) divided into five symptom categories: reflux, abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhoea and constipation [24].",1
"The symptom category sub-scores represent the mean value of the included items, and the average of the mean sub-score values determines the total questionnaire score.",1
"The SmartPill wireless motility capsule (Medtronic, USA) was used to assess segmental transit times, defined as the time it takes for the capsule to pass the stomach, small bowel, colon and the whole gut.",1
"The MotiliGI software (version 3.1) was used for data analysis, and two independent investigators analysed the data [30].",1
"Data were compared with normative values for segmental transit times, and those exceeding the 95th percentile were categorised as prolonged [31].",1
Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) was evaluated using the handheld VAGUS device.,1
The VAGUS device was used to determine whether the participants met the criteria for enrolment and it was used at baseline and after each study period [25].,1
"Heart rate variability in response to a cardiovascular autonomic reflex test (lying-to-standing, expiration/inspiration and Valsalva manoeuvre) was registered as pathological if values fell below a predefined age-specific cut-off [32].",1
"Based on the total score, the participant was categorised as having either absent (0), early (1) or manifest (2Ð3) CAN [33].",1
"Cardiac vagal tone (CVT) representing the parasympathetic efferent activity was assessed using an eMotion Faros device (Mega Electronics, Finland) at baseline, immediately after the first stimulation (acute effect) and after each study period (long-term effects).",1
"The device is an electrocardiogram monitor that measures heart rate and phase shifts in the beat-to-beat interval during a 5 min recording with the participant resting in a seated position [34, 35].",1
"An online application provided by ProBioMetrics (version 1.0, UK) was used to determine the CVT.",1
CAN is indicated by a CVT value below 3.18 on a linear vagal scale where 0 represents full blockage of the parasympathetic acetylcholine neurotransmitter [34].,1
The primary outcome measures were the changes in gastrointestinal symptoms assessed using the GCSI and the GSRS in both study periods.,1
"Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptom scores adjusted for covariates, symptom category sub-scores, gastrointestinal segmental transit times, CAN score and CVT.",1
"The gastrointestinal transit times were only assessed before and after study period 2, while all other outcomes were evaluated before and after each study period.",1
"For each treatment group, 60 participants were required to detect a 30% difference in gastrointestinal symptoms measured by the GCSI in each study period.",1
"The trial was adequately powered according to the severity of symptoms seen in the clinic, as reported previously [22].",1
Participants who received at least one dose of tVNS or sham stimulation were included in the intention-to-treat analyses of the primary outcomes and adverse events.,1
"When analysing the secondary outcomes, participants who completed the study period for the specific outcome were included in per-protocol analyses.",1
Data were collected and handled using the electronic data management tool REDCap (https://www.project-redcap.org/).,1
Missing data were not imputed.,1
"Baseline data are reported as means ± SD for normally distributed data, medians and IQRs for non-normally distributed data, or counts with frequencies.",1
Compliance percentages were determined by comparing the number of registered stimulations to the total number of possible stimulations in each study period.,1
"Compliance percentages for day 1 in study period 1 were excluded because of inconsistent registration in the stimulation diary, as either first or second stimulation of the day.",1
Primary and secondary outcomes were analysed as the change from the study period baseline in both study periods.,1
These baseline-corrected values were compared between treatment groups using non-paired t tests for normally distributed data and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for non-normally distributed data.,1
"As a secondary outcome, multivariate linear regression analyses were used to investigate the symptom scores after each study period adjusted for the baseline symptom scores between treatment groups.",1
"The regression analyses were further adjusted for demographic characteristics, including sex, age, type and duration of diabetes and inclusion site.",1
"The model was further adjusted for compliance, baseline CAN score, CVT and gastric emptying time.",1
The multivariate regression model was then used in a sensitivity analysis to compare participants who received active tVNS with compliance above 80% to those who received sham stimulation.,1
"Participants with a gastrointestinal symptom reduction of at least 30% in one or both questionnaires were considered responders, and were compared using a binary regression model between treatment groups.",1
Participants exhibiting baseline symptoms beyond Ômild symptomsÕ in the GCSI or the GSRS were compared in between-group comparisons using non-paired t tests.,1
Adverse events were also evaluated between groups using a binary regression model.,1
Gastrointestinal transit times that changed from pathological to normal and vice versa were compared using a non-parametric _2 test.,1
"Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 17.0 (StataCorp, USA).",1
"Between June 2020 and April 2022, 131 participants receiving at least one dose of tVNS were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (Fig. 1).",1
Four of the 63 participants in the active group (6.3%) discontinued the trial before the final visit in study period 2.,1
"Overall, one person in the active group (study period 1) and three in the sham group (wash-out period and study period 2) withdrew for personal reasons.",1
"Two in the active group and one in the sham group had unacceptably poor compliance in study period 2, while two in the sham group found the trial too time-consuming (one in each study period).",1
"Furthermore, one person in the sham group had health problems (depression) (wash-out period), one was lost to follow-up (wash-out period), two thought the stimulation was a sham (study period 1), and one felt no treatment effect, leading to drop out (study period 2).",1
"Additionally, one person in the active group experienced a tVNS-related adverse event (hoarseness) in study period 2.",1
"All participants exhibited either an abnormal CAN score or an abnormal COMPASS31 score at baseline, and none were included exclusively based on low sudomotor function.",1
"The treatment groups were comparable regarding baseline demographic, clinical and autonomic characteristics (Table 1).",1
Compliance was 88.5% in the active group and 87.5% in the sham group for participants completing study period 1.,1
Compliance in participants completing study period 2 was 86.3% in the active group and 85.1% in the sham group.,1
Compliance rates for the two study periods are shown in Fig. 2,1
"In study period 1, there was no difference in symptom score Although it was not a primary outcome, treatment responses were analysed.",1
"In study period 1, 21 of 63 participants (33.3%) in the active group were responders, compared with 23 of 68 participants (33.8%) in the sham group (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.61, 1.60; p=0.95).",1
"In study period 2, 26 of 62 participants (41.9%) in the active group were responders, compared with 24 of 62 participants (38.7%) in the sham group (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.71, 1.66; p=0.71).",1
The multivariate linear regression analyses confirmed similar symptom changes between treatment groups when adjusting for demographic covariates.,1
"Additionally, adjusting for compliance, baseline values for the CAN score, CVT and gastric emptying time did not affect the difference in symptom scores between groups (Table 3).",1
Sensitivity analyses comparing participants in the active group who showed compliance >80% with those in the sham group showed similar symptom score differences when adjusting for the same covariates (Table 4).reductions between the treatment groups (Fig. 3).,1
The GCSI reduction was _0.26 ± 0.64 in the participants receiving active tVNS (mean ± SD) and _0.17 ± 0.62 in the sham group (p=0.44) (Table 2).,1
"Similarly, the GSRS decreased by _0.35 ± 0.62 after active stimulation and by _0.32 ± 0.59 in the sham group (p=0.77).",1
There were no differences in symptom scores between the groups in study period 2.,1
The GCSI decreased by _0.47 ± 0.78 after active stimulation and by _0.33 ± 0.75 in the sham group (p=0.34).,1
The mean GSRS symptom reduction was _0.46 ± 0.90 in the active group compared with _0.35 ± 0.79 in the sham group (p=0.50).,1
"Figure 4 presents the GCSI and GSRS scores assessed weekly during study period 2, with no differences being observed between the treatment groups.",1
Changes in symptom category sub-scores from each questionnaire were comparable between groups (Table 2).,1
No differences were seen between the groups during either study period when analysing the symptom change in only participants with a baseline GCSI >2 or GSRS >3 (all p>0.50).,1
Transit times measured before and after study period 2 are presented in Fig. 5,1
"In the active group, one participant with a gastric emptying time that was over 10 SD above the mean value was excluded from the analysis.",1
"A median gastric emptying time increase of 23 min (IQR _36 to 116 min) was observed in the active group, while the sham group experienced a median decrease of _19 min (IQR _90 to 93 min) (p=0.04).",1
"No differences were seen when comparing the small-bowel, colonic or whole-gut transit times (Table 2).",1
The proportions of transit time measurements that changed from pathological to normal were comparable between treatment groups (all p values >0.16).,1
Table 2 provides information on cardiovascular autonomic measurements.,1
"No differences were seen in the sub-scores that comprise the CAN score, except for the inspiration/expiration ratio in study period 1, where the sham group showed a higher median decrease (_0.02; IQR _0.06 to 0.02) than the active group (_0.01; IQR _0.02 to 0.03) (p=0.02).",1
Neither acute nor long-term changes in CVT were observed.,1
"Sixteen participants (25.4%) receiving active tVNS and 13 participants (19.1%) receiving sham stimulation had at least one adverse event (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.70, 2.61; p=0.36).",1
"These numbers include the one participant experiencing hoarseness after active tVNS, which led to trial discontinuation.",1
"Otherwise, the active group mainly experienced tension headaches and muscular discomfort at the stimulation site, while five participants in each group reported increased gastrointestinal complaints.",1
"To our knowledge, this is the first randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial assessing the clinical effect of tVNS on gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with diabetes and autonomic neuropathy.",1
The active and sham stimulation similarly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms during a short-term high-intensity stimulation period and a long-term medium-intensity stimulation period.,1
"A minor increase was seen for gastric emptying in the active group, but otherwise, segmental gastrointestinal transit times, CAN score and CVT were similar between the treatment arms.",1
The gammaCore device is optimised to induce signals in the afferent myelinated A_ vagal nerve fibres [16].,1
"Assessing somatosensory evoked brain potentials and performing functional magnetic resonance scans of the brain and brainstem during cervical tVNS has demonstrated the activation of vagal fibres in healthy individuals [14, 36, 37].",1
"Studies in animals and healthy individuals have shown that tVNS modulates fundamental patterns of gastrointestinal motility and increases heart rate variability measurements [11Ð13, 38, 39].",1
"Thus, tVNS is believed to stimulate afferent vagal nerve fibres, transmitting the signals to the brainstem and the brain, where an efferent vagal nerve signal is conveyed to the gastrointestinal system [40].",1
"There is a lack of standardisation for tVNS regarding the intensity, frequency, pulse duration, length, anatomical site and type of device.",1
"As a result, it is challenging to compare results across studies [41].",1
"Two smaller observational, non-randomised, uncontrolled studies investigated the effect of cervical tVNS in individuals with medically refractory and severely symptomatic gastroparesis of various aetiologies, including diabetes [17, 18].",1
Both studies reported a decreased symptomatic burden in 35Ð40% of the participants.,1
"The present trial shows a comparable proportion of responders in both treatment arms, stressing the importance of having a placebo group.",1
Our participants are different from those in the above-mentioned studies.,1
"First, we only included participants with diabetes.",1
"Second, a verified gastroparesis diagnosis was not a criterion for inclusion as this measure correlates poorly with symptoms [6] and shows large intra-study variability (see below).",1
"Third, as diabetic gastroenteropathy is a pan-enteric condition, we included patients with a broader spectrum of symptoms than just the cardinal symptoms of gastroparesis.",1
"In the present study, most participants also complained of upper gastrointestinal symptoms as evaluated by the overall GCSI and by the symptom category sub-scores for nausea/vomiting, bloating and fullness.",1
The bloating and fullness sub-scores were the primary drivers for the symptom decrease in the active group but no difference in these sub-scores was seen when comparing the treatment groups.,1
The cut-off value defining a symptomatic response to a given treatment lacks consensus.,1
We defined treatment success as a 30% decrease in one or both symptom scores.,1
This threshold was chosen to reflect the fact that a higher baseline symptom score may lead to a more prominent symptom reduction than a lower baseline score.,1
The proportion of responders increased twofold when applying the 0.75-point GCSI cut-off used in the above-mentioned observational studies.,1
"However, the proportion of responders in the active and sham groups remained comparable.",1
"A randomised, double-blind pilot study has investigated the effect of cervical tVNS on lower gastrointestinal symptoms in 19 individuals with ParkinsonÕs disease and gastrointestinal complaints.",1
"It showed a GSRS symptom reduction in the active arm, but no differences were observed when comparing the post-treatment symptom scores between the active and sham groups [42].",1
"In line with this study, we also observed a degree of GSRS symptom reduction across treatment groups.",1
"Anatomical variations between men and women, such as differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue, muscular density and subjective compliance, may influence these outcomes.",1
"Therefore, sex was included as a covariate in the multiple linear regression analyses, but it did not alter the overall conclusions, and the results are most likely applicable to both sexes in the population.",1
Most studies have not demonstrated changes in gastric emptying following the implantation of gastric neurostimulators [7].,1
"In contrast, we found a minor increase in gastric emptying time in the active group, but no changes were seen for small-bowel or colonic transit times.",1
A longer gastric emptying time has the potential to increase symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.,1
"Thus, these findings contradicted the anticipated outcome of the tVNS treatment.",1
"We observed quite large intra-individual and inter-individual transit time variations, especially for gastric emptying time, which are unsurprising.",1
Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals with diabetes and upper gastrointestinal symptoms have more significant transit time fluctuations than healthy individuals [21].,1
One study investigated diabetic and non-diabetic individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms.,1
"It showed that, across two subsequent measurements 14Ð16 days apart, 30% of the participants had a different gastric emptying time (normal, more rapid or delayed) [43].",1
"This is in line with the present study, in which 24% of participants in the active group and 31% in the sham group had different gastric emptying times (pathological or normal) when comparing assessments before and after study period 2.",1
"In the present study, tVNS changed neither the CAN score nor the CVT.",1
"In healthy individuals, tVNS was shown to increase CVT [13].",1
"In individuals with chronic pancreatitis, a study showed increased CVT when combining tVNS with deep, slow breathing, but another study showed no effect [44, 45].",1
"In individuals with gastroparesis of various aetiologies, cervical tVNS did not improve heart rate variability [18].",1
"In the present study, the median CVT was in the lowest part of the normal range and below the cut-off for recognising established CAN [34, 35].",1
"Furthermore, more than 50% of the participants had an abnormal CAN score at baseline, representing early or manifest CAN.",1
"Thus, tVNS may not effectively induce a sufficient efferent nervous signal to change the heart rate variability in individuals with autonomic neuropathy.",1
"The present study has notable strengths, including examining short-term high-intensity and long-term medium-intensity tVNS using a randomised, sham-controlled and double-blind design.",1
"The involvement of multiple centres allowed inclusion of more participants, further strengthening the study.",1
"Additionally, compliance levels were high and consistent across the active and sham groups.",1
There are also several limitations.,1
"First, the tVNS was self-administered without real-time assessment of vagal nerve fibre activation.",1
"Therefore, it is impossible to directly determine the ÔexposureÕ to the active stimulation.",1
"Second, the intended vagal modulation may be hampered by autonomic neuropathy in any of the vagal neurocircuits within the brainstem, midbrain and higher cortical centres controlling gastrointestinal motility [46].",1
"Third, no established standards exist for stimulation duration and daily treatment frequency for treating gastrointestinal symptoms.",1
"However, the dosage of two consecutive 120 s stimulations twice daily has proven effective as a prophylactic approach for treating primary headaches [16, 47].",1
"Previous studies targeting gastrointestinal symptoms have often used two to four daily stimulations [17, 18, 42].",1
"Long-term treatment compliance may be limited by the time-consuming nature of the handheld application, especially with treatment frequencies exceeding two daily stimulations.",1
"Fourth, the participants had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, reducing the homogeneity of the cohort.",1
"However, studies have shown a comparable prevalence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy between the diabetes categories [6].",1
Adjusting for diabetes type in the multiple linear regression analyses did not affect the symptom score difference between treatment arms.,1
"Fifth, autonomic neuropathy was determined using either the COMPASS31 questionnaire to assess autonomic symptoms, the VAGUS device to evaluate cardiovascular autonomic reflex test, or the SUDOSCAN device to estimate sudomotor function by measuring electrochemical skin conductance.",1
These methods are all broadly accessible and easy to use.,1
"While more accurate methods exist, they are more complex and time consuming, making them unsuitable for this study [33, 48].",1
"In addition, the SUDOSCAN measurement is only a surrogate measure of autonomic function, and the sweat response may not be exclusively induced by sympathetic autonomic fibres [49].",1
"Sixth, measures of transit times were based on wireless motility capsule data.",1
"Thus, the accuracy of the gastric emptying time may be lower than that of scintigraphic measures, as the solid capsule can be expelled from the stomach in the fasting state after emptying the solid meal [50].",1
"However, gastric emptying times obtained using wireless motility capsules have been shown to correlate with 4 h scintigraphy measurements (sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.92) [50, 51].",1
The rationale for choosing the wireless motility capsules in the present study was to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of pan-enteric transit times in these individuals with multiregional dysmotility [1].,1
"Seventh, the incorporation of a 2-week wash-out period between the study periods aimed to assess the efficacy of each treatment regimen independently, preventing potential carry-over effects from study period 1 that may interfere with study period 2.",1
"However, introducing a wash-out period also increases the risk of relative unblinding, particularly if the tVNS treatment demonstrated clinical effectiveness.",1
"Eighth, the observed symptom scores were generally lower than in previous studies investigating individuals with gastroparesis.",1
"Nonetheless, when only analysing participants with more than Ômild symptomsÕ, the symptom changes were still comparable between groups.",1
"Lastly, the sham device only produces a humming sound, and the active device often induces twitching in the superficial facial muscles unilaterally.",1
"Thus, unintentional unblinding of participants during the trial is a potential risk.",1
"In conclusion, the present randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind study provided no evidence of gastrointestinal symptom relief when applying short-term high-intensity or long-term medium-intensity cervical tVNS in individuals with diabetic gastroenteropathy compared with sham stimulation.",1
"Hence, tVNS in this format is probably not a recommendable adjuvant treatment to ease the burden of gastrointestinal symptoms in these individuals.",1
"Increased NGSC was also observed for individual-defined brain areas62 (Fig. 3c; LME model, estimate (95% CI)_=_0.0149 (0.0071, 0.0228), t(265)_=_3.74, P_=_2.30___10_4, uncorrected), with the largest increases in association cortex and minimal changes in primary cortex (Fig. 3d).",1
Global and local desynchronization replicated in an LSD dataset56 (Fig.,1
3e) and the distribution of these effects correlated with 5-HT2A receptor density (Fig.,1
"3f; bivariate correlation NGSCpsilocybin to Cimbi-36 binding, r_=_0.39, P_=_1.9___10_13; NGSCLSD to Cimbi-36 binding, r_=_0.32, P_=_4.5___10_9, uncorrected)33,63.",1
"To investigate how psilocybin-driven brain changes are influenced by task states, participants were asked to complete a simple auditoryÐvisual matching task in the scanner (Methods, perceptual fMRI task).",1
Participants performed this task with more than 80% accuracy during drug sessions (Extended Data Fig. 8aÐc).,1
"Engagement in the task significantly decreased the magnitude of psilocybin-associated network disruption and desynchronization (Fig. 4; LME model interaction of task___psilocybin: FC change P_=_5.49___10_5, NGSC P_=_4.82___10_8, uncorrected).",1
These results were robust to scan order effects (Supplementary Fig. 6) and regression of evoked responses (Supplementary Fig. 7).,1
The reduction of psilocybin-driven brain changes during task performance seems to parallel the psychological principle of ÔgroundingÕ: directing oneÕs attention externally as a means of alleviating intense or distressing thoughts or emotions.,1
Grounding techniques are commonly used in psychedelic-associated psychotherapy to lessen overwhelming or distressing effects of psilocybin64.,1
"Task-related reductions in network desynchronization provide strong evidence for context-dependent effects of psilocybin on brain activity and FC65 and fill an important gap between preclinical studies of context dependence66,67 and clinical observations68.",1
"Classical animal studies documented that psychedelics reduce optic tract responses to photic stimulation of the retina, indirectly reducing visual cortex activation69,70.",1
We replicated these effects by documenting reduced task-evoked responses in primary visual cortex (Extended Data Fig. 8dÐg).,1
"To assess whether psilocybin affects the magnitude of hemodynamic responses elsewhere, we analysed evoked responses during the perceptual task in other task-related regions of interest (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g).",1
"But the magnitudes of other evoked responses were not significantly changed by psilocybin (two-way analysis of variance of drug and participant; effect of drug: left V1 P_=_0.03, right V1 P_=_0.02, all other P_>_0.1, uncorrected).",1
"To assess whether persistent neurotrophic and psychological effects of psychedelics might be associated with persistent FC changes after psilocybin, we compared FC changes 1Ð21_days post-psilocybin to pre-psilocybin.",1
"Whole-brain FC change scores were small (normalized FC change (range) of 1.05 (0.94, 1.27)), indicating that the brainÕs network structure had mostly returned to baseline (Extended Data Fig. 2).",1
Atypical cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms30 and hippocampus neurogenesis is observed after psilocybin6.,1
"Further, acute decreases in hippocampal glutamate after psilocybin correlate with decreased DMN connectivity and ego dissolution21.",1
"Thus, we investigated whether the same region of the anterior hippocampus that showed strong acute FC change also showed persistent FC change.",1
"We observed significant FC change in the 3_week postdrug period (Fig. 5a,b; LME mean change 0.095, PpreÐpost-psilocybin_=_0.0033, uncorrected).",1
"No persistent FC differences were observed post-MTP (Methods, section ÔPersistent effects analysisÕ; LME ÔFC changeÕ 90% CI (_0.056, 0.080); equivalence __=_±0.086, PpreÐpost-MTP_=_0.77).",1
"FC between the anterior hippocampus and DMN was decreased postpsilocybin (Fig. 5c,d).",1
"Time-course visualization, after aligning them so that psilocybin dose was day 0, suggests that connectivity is reduced for 3_weeks following a single psilocybin dose (Fig. 5d; AntHip-DMN FC mean (95% CI): pre-psilocybin was 0.180 (0.169, 0.192); post-psilocybin was 0.163 (0.150, 0.176)).",1
"AntHip-DMN FC values returned to pre-psilocybin baseline by the replication visit 6Ð12_months later, however, the smaller replication sample (n_=_4 with one pre-psilocybin visit each) was not statistically powered to detect small changes.",1
"This observation is compelling, as it localized to the anterior hippocampus, a brain region showing substantial synaptogenesis following psilocybin6.",1
Reduced hippocampal-cortical FC may reflect increased plasticity of self-oriented hippocampal circuits31 (Fig. 5e).,1
The synchronized patterns of cofluctuations during the resting state are believed to reflect the brainÕs perpetual task of modelling reality71.,1
"It follows that the stability of functional network organization across day, task, MTP and arousal levels (but not between individuals), reflects the subjective stability of waking consciousness.",1
"By contrast, the much larger changes induced by psilocybin fit with participantsÕ subjective reports of a radical change in consciousness.",1
"The large magnitude of effects of psilocybin, in comparison to the effects of MTP, suggests that observed changes are not merely due to increased arousal or non-specific effects of monoaminergic stimulation72.",1
Our observation that psychedelics desynchronize brain activity regionally and globally provides a bridge between previous findings at the micro- and macro-scales of neuroscience.,1
"Multi-unit recording studies suggest that agonism of 5-HT2A receptors by psychedelics does not uniformly increase or decrease firing of pyramidal neurons, but rather serves to desynchronize pairs or populations of neurons that co-activate under typical conditions60.",1
"Meanwhile, previous resting fMRI studies have reported a range of acute changes following ingestion of psilocybin55,63, ayahuasca73 and LSD56,74, which broadly converge on a loss of network connectivity and an increase in global integration24,75.",1
"Disruption of synchronized activity at several scales may explain the paradoxical observation that psychedelics produce an increase in metabolic activity19,20, a decrease in the power of local fluctuations22,76 and a loss of the brainÕs segregated network structure23,56.",1
"This desynchronization of neural activity has been described as an increase in entropy or randomness of brain activity in the psychedelic state77,78.",1
Our results support the hypothesis that these changes underpin the cognitive and perceptual changes associated with psychedelics.,1
The dramatic departure from typical synchronized patterns of co-activity may be key to understanding the acute effects of psilocybin and also its persistent neurotrophic effects.,1
"Changes in resting activity are linked to shifts in glutamate-dependent signalling during psilocybin exposure21,79,80.",1
"This phenomenon, shared by ketamine and psychedelics, engages homeostatic plasticity mechanisms81,82, a neurobiological response to large deviations in typical network activity patterns83Ð85.",1
"This response to novelty includes rapid upregulation in expression of BDNF, MTOR, EEF2 and other plasticity-related immediate early genes8,80, which are thought to have a key role in the antidepressant response86.",1
"Consistent with this notion, psilocybin produced the largest changes in the DMN, frequently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders34,35,87Ð91, and in a region of the anterior and middle hippocampus associated with the self29,92 and the present moment93.",1
"Psychedelics rapidly induce synaptogenesis in the hippocampus and cortex, effects that seem to be necessary for rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models7,17.",1
"However, understanding the underpinnings of the behavioural effects of psychedelics requires human studies.",1
"Advances in precision functional mapping37,94,95 and individual-level characterization enabled us to identify desynchronization of resting-state fMRI signals, connect these changes with subjective psychedelic effects and localize these changes to depression-relevant circuits (DMN, hippocampus).",1
"These analyses rely on precise characterization of an individualsÕ baseline brain organization (for example, individual definition of brain areas, networks and day-to-day variability) to understand how that organization is altered by an intervention.",1
This precision drug mechanism study was conducted in non-depressed volunteers.,1
Verification of the proposed antidepressant mechanism of psilocybin will require precision patient studies.,1
"New methods to measure neurotrophic markers in the human brain96 will provide a critical link between mechanistic observations at the cellular, brain networks and psychological levels.",1
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and procedures established by the Washington University in Saint Louis Institutional Review Board.,1
All participants were compensated for their time.,1
"All aspects of this study were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSOM) Internal Review Board, the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (WU HRPO), the Federal Drug Administration (IND no. 202002165) and the Missouri Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) under a federal DEA schedule 1 research licence and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04501653.",1
Psilocybin was supplied by Usona Institute through Almac Clinical Services.,1
"Healthy young adults (n_=_7, 18Ð45_years) were enrolled between April 2021 and March 2023 in a randomized cross-over precision functional brain mapping study at Washington University in Saint Louis (see Supplementary Methods for inclusion and exclusion criteria).",1
"The purpose of the study was to evaluate differences in individual-level connectomics before, during and after psilocybin exposure.",1
"Participants underwent imaging during drug sessions (with MRI starting 1_h after drug ingestion) with 25 mg psilocybin or 40 mg MTP, as well as non-drug imaging sessions.",1
"Drug condition categories were (1) baseline, (2) drug 1 (MTP or psilocybin), (3) between, (4) drug 2 and (5) after.",1
Randomization allocation was conducted using REDCap and generated by team members who prepared study materials including drug or placebo but otherwise had no contact with participants.,1
"A minimum of three non-drug imaging sessions were completed during each non-drug window: baseline, between and after drug sessions.",1
"The number of non-drug MRI sessions was dependent on availability of the participant, scanner and scanner support staff.",1
Dosing day imaging sessions were conducted 60Ð180_min following drug administration during peak blood concentration98.,1
"One participant (P2) was not able tolerate fMRI while on psilocybin, and had trouble staying awake on numerous fMRI visits after psilocybin and was thus excluded from analysis (except for data quality metrics in Extended Data Fig. 1).",1
"MTP was selected as the active control condition to simulate the cardiovascular effects and physiological arousal (that is, controlling for dopaminergic effects) associated with psilocybin99.",1
"Usona Institute, a US non-profit medical research organization, provided good manufacturing practices for psilocybin.",1
"Drug sessions were facilitated by two clinical research staff who completed an approved in-person or online facilitator training programme provided by Usona Institute, as part of the phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03866174).",1
"The role of the study facilitators was to build a therapeutic alliance with the participant throughout the study, prepare them for their drug dosing days and to observe and maintain participant safety during dosing day visits64.",1
The pair consisted of an experienced clinician (lead clinical facilitator) and a trainee (cofacilitator).,1
"The predefined primary outcome measure was precision functional mapping (numerous visits, very long scans to produce individual connectomes) examining the effects of psilocybin on cortical and cortico- subcortical brain networks that could explain its rapid and sustained behavioural effects.",1
"Predefined secondary outcome measures included (1) assessment of hemodynamic response to evaluate how 5-HT2A receptor agonism by psychedelics may alter neurovascular coupling, (2) assessment of acute psychological effects of psilocybin using the MEQ30 score (Supplementary Methods) and (3) assessment of personality change using the International Personality Item Pool-Five-Factor Model100.",1
Changes in pulse rate and respiratory rate during psilocybin and placebo were later added as secondary outcome measures and personality change was abandoned because it was clear that we would not be powered to detect personality change.,1
Participants were invited to return 6Ð12_months after completing the initial cross-over study for a replication protocol.,1
"This included 1Ð2 baseline fMRIs, a psilocybin session (identical to the initial session, except for lack of blinding) and 1Ð2 ÔafterÕ sessions within 4_days of the dose.",1
Healthy adults aged 18Ð45_years were recruited by campus-wide advertisement and colleague referral.,1
Participants (n_=_7) were enrolled from March 2021 to May 2023.,1
"Participants were required to have had at least one previous lifetime psychedelic exposure (for example, psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca, LSD), but no psychedelics exposure within the past 6_months.",1
"Individuals with psychiatric illness (depression, psychosis or addiction) based on the DSM-5 were excluded.",1
Demographics and data summary details are provided in Supplementary Table 1.,1
One of the authors (N.U.F.D.) was a study participant.,1
Participants were scanned roughly every other day over the course of the experiment (Extended Data Fig. 1).,1
Imaging was performed at a consistent time of day to minimize diurnal effects in FC101.,1
Neuroimaging was performed on a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens) in the neuroimaging laboratories at the Washington University Medical Center.,1
"Structural scans (T1w and T2w) were acquired for each participant at 0.9_mm isotropic resolution, with real-time motion correction.",1
Structural scans from different sessions were averaged together for the purposes of Freesurfer segmentation and nonlinear atlas registrations.,1
"To capture high-resolution images of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, we used an echo-planar imaging sequence102 with 2_mm isotropic voxels, multiband 6, multi-echo 5 (times to echo: 14.20, 38.93, 63.66, 88.39, 113.12_ms)103, repetition or relaxation time: 1,761_ms, flip angle of 68¡ and in-plane acceleration104 (IPAT or grappa) of 2.",1
This sequence acquired 72 axial slices (144_mm coverage).,1
"Each resting scan included 510 frames (lasting 15_min, 49_s) as well as three frames at the end used to provide estimate electronic noise.",1
"Every session included two 15-min resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scans, during which participants were instructed to hold still and look at a white fixation crosshair presented on a black background.",1
Head motion was tracked in real time using Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring software (FIRMM)105.,1
An eye-tracking camera (EyeLink) was used to monitor participants for drowsiness.,1
Participants also completed a previously validated event-related fMRI task.,1
"This was a suprathreshold auditoryÐvisual matching task in which participants were presented with a naturalistic visual image (duration 500_ms) and coincident spoken English phrase, and were asked to respond with a button press to indicate whether the image and phrase were ÔcongruentÕ (for example, an image of a beach and the spoken word ÔbeachÕ) or ÔincongruentÕ.",1
Both accuracy and response time of button presses were recorded.,1
Each trial was followed by a jittered inter-stimulus interval optimized for event-related designs.,1
"In a subset of imaging sessions, two task fMRI scans were completed following the two resting scans.",1
"Task fMRI scans used the same sequence used in resting fMRI, included 48 trials (24 congruent, 24 incongruent) and lasted a total of 410_s.",1
"In analyses, high motion frames were censored106 and the two task scans were concatenated to better match the length of the rs-fMRI scans.",1
Note the stimulus order in the two trials did not vary across session.,1
The order of rest and task scans was not counterbalanced across sessions to avoid concern that task scans may influence subsequent rest scans.,1
Resting fMRI data were preprocessed using an in-house processing pipeline.,1
"In brief, this included removal of thermal noise using NORDIC denoising107Ð109, correction for slice timing and field distortions, alignment, optimal combination of many echoes by weighted summation110, normalization, nonlinear registration, bandpass filtering and scrubbing at a movement threshold of 0.3_mm to remove reduce the influence of confounds111.",1
"Tissue-based regressors were computed in volume (white matter, ventricles, extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid)112 and applied following projection to surface.",1
Task-based regressors were only applied when indicated.,1
Details on rs-fMRI preprocessing are provided in Supplementary Methods.,1
"Visualizations of motion, physiological traces and signal across the brain (ÔgrayplotsÕ) before and after processing113 are provided in Supplementary Video 1.",1
Surface generation and processing of functional data followed similar procedures to Glasser et al.114.,1
"To compare FC and resting-state networks across participants, we used a group-based surface parcellation and community assignments generated previously62.",1
"For subcortical regions, we used a set of regions of interest115 generated to achieve full coverage and optimal region homogeneity.",1
"A subcortical limbic network was defined on the basis of neuroanatomy: amygdala, anteromedial thalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus116,117.",1
"These regions were expanded to cover anatomical structures (for example, anterior hippocampus)31.",1
"To generate region-wise connectivity matrices, time courses of all surface vertices or subcortical voxels within a region were averaged.",1
FC was then computed between each region timeseries using a bivariate correlation and then Fisher z-transformed for group comparison.,1
"We identified canonical large-scale networks using the individual-specific network matching approach described previously43,44,62.",1
"In brief, cortical surface and subcortical volume assignments were derived using the graph-theory-based Infomap algorithm118.",1
"In this approach, we calculated the correlation matrix from all cortical vertices and subcortical voxels, concatenated across all a participantÕs scans.",1
Correlations between vertices within 30_mm of each other were set to zero.,1
The Infomap algorithm was applied to each participantÕs correlation matrix thresholded at a range of edge densities spanning from 0.01 to 2%.,1
"At each threshold, the algorithm returned community identities for each vertex and voxel.",1
Communities were labelled by matching them at each threshold to a set of independent group average networks described previously62.,1
"In each individual and in the average, a ÔconsensusÕ network assignment was derived by collapsing assignments across thresholds, giving each node the assignment it had at the sparsest possible threshold at which it was successfully assigned to one of the known group networks.",1
"See Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1 for individual and group mode assignments, respectively.",1
"The following networks were included: the association networks including the DMN, fronto-parietal, dorsal attention, parietal memory, ventral attention, action-mode, salience and context networks; and the primary networks including the visual, somato-motor, somato-motor face and auditory networks.",1
"To compute local (areal) desynchronization, we also defined brain areas at the individual level using a previously described areal parcellation approach39.",1
"In brief, for each participant, vertex-wise FC was averaged across all sessions to generate a dense connectome.",1
"Then, abrupt transitions in FC values across neighbouring vertices were used to identify boundaries between distinct functional areas.",1
"To take advantage of the multilevel precision functional mapping study design, a LME model was used.",1
"Every scan was labelled on the following dimensions: participant identity (ID), MRI visit, task (task or rest), drug condition (prepsilocybin, psilocybin, MTP, postpsilocybin) and head motion (average framewise displacement).",1
"The rs-fMRI metrics (described below) were set as the dependent variable, drug (drug condition), task, framewise displacement (motion) and drug___task were defined as fixed effects, and participant ID and MRI session were random effects.",1
"Let yij be the rs-fMRI metric (for example, FC change score at a given vertex) for the jth observation (15_min fMRI scan) within the ith participant.",1
The LME model can be written as: _______=__0+__d_r_u_g_d_r_u_g_____+__F_D_F_D_____+__t_a_s_k_t_a_s_k_____+__task_by_drug_t_a_s_k______d_r_u_g_____+__0___+__0___+_______. _0 is the intercept term.,1
"_drug, _FD, _task and _task-by-drug are the coefficients for the fixed effects predictors.",1
"drugij, frame displacementij (FDij) and taskij are the values of the fixed effects predictors for the jth observation within the ith group.",1
"u0i represents the random intercept for the ith participant, accounting for individual-specific variability.",1
"v0j represents the random intercept for the jth observation within the ith participant, capturing scan-specific variability.",1
_ij is the error term representing unobserved random variation.,1
"In MATLAB (Wilkinsonian notation), this model is expressed for every vertex Y(vertex)_=_fitlme(groupd, FC_Change(vertex)_~_drug_+_framewise displacement_+ task_+_task-by-drug_+_(1_ SubID)_+_(1 session)).",1
"To compensate for the implementations of this LME model on many rs-fMRI-related dependent variables, differences were highlighted when P_<_0.001.",1
All P values reported are not corrected for multiple comparisons.,1
"FC change (ÔdistanceÕ) was calculated at the vertex level to generate FC change maps and a LME model (equation (1)) was used in combination with wild bootstrapping119,120 and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE)95,121 to estimate P values for t-statistic maps resulting from the model (Figs. 1aÐd and 4).",1
"Wild bootstrapping is an approach to permutation testing that was designed for models that are not independent and identically distributed, and are heteroscedastic.",1
"First, a FC change map was generated for every scan by computing, for each vertex, the average distance between its FC seedmap and the FC seedmap for each of that participantÕs baseline scans.",1
"As each participant had several baseline visits, FC change was computed for baseline scans by computing distance from all other baseline scans (excluding scans within the same visit).",1
This provided a measure of day-to-day variability.,1
"Second, the distance value was used as the dependent variable yij in the LME model to generate a t-statistic.",1
"Third, a wild bootstrapping procedure was implemented as follows.",1
"Several bootstrap samples (B_=_1,000) were generated using the Rademacher procedure120, in which the residuals were randomly inverted.",1
"Specifically, a Rademacher vector was generated by randomly assigning _1 or 1 values with equal probability to the residual of each observation.",1
"By element-wise multiplication of the original residuals with the Rademacher vector, bootstrap samples were created to capture the variability in the data.",1
"For the observed t-statistic-map and each bootstrap sample, the TFCE algorithm was applied to enhance the sensitivity to clusters of significant voxels or regions while controlling for multiple comparisons.",1
The value of the enhanced cluster statistic derived from the bootstrap samples was used to create a null distribution under the null hypothesis.,1
"By comparing the original observed cluster statistic with the null distribution, P values were derived to quantify the statistical significance of the observed effect.",1
The P values were obtained on the basis of the proportion of bootstrap samples that produced a maximum cluster statistic exceeding the observed cluster statistic.,1
"The combined approach of wild bootstrapping with the Rademacher procedure and TFCE provided the method to estimate P values for our multilevel (drug condition, participant, session, task) design.",1
"This methodology accounted for the complex correlation structure, effectively controlled for multiple comparisons and accommodated potential autocorrelation in the residuals through the Rademacher procedure.",1
"By incorporating these techniques, association with psilocybin and other conditions was reliably identified amid noise and spatial dependencies.",1
"For analyses in Figs. 1e,g, 2 and 4a (bottom), Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 3, 4 and 6, distance calculations were computed on the FC matrix using z-transformed bivariate correlation of time courses from parcellated brain areas62.",1
"The effects of day-to-day, drug condition, task and framewise displacement and drug___task were directly examined by calculating the distance between functional network matrices generated from each scan.",1
"Root-mean-squared Euclidean distance was computed between the linearized upper triangles of the parcellated FC matrix between each pair of 15_min fMRI scans, creating a second-order distance matrix (Extended Data Fig. 3).",1
"Subsequently, the average distance (reported as Ôwhole-brain FC changeÕ) was examined for FC matrices that were from the same individual within a single session, from the same individual across days (Ôday-to-dayÕ), from the same participant between drug and baseline (for example, psilocybin), from the same individual but different tasks (Ôtask:restÕ), from the same individual between highest motion scans and baseline (Ôhi:lo motionÕ), from different individuals (Ôbetween personÕ).",1
"In the Ôhigh head motionÕ comparison (Ôhi:lo motionÕ in Supplementary Fig. 3), the two non-drug scans with the highest average framewise displacement were labelled and compared against all other baseline scans.",1
A LME model (equation (1)) and post hoc t-tests were used to assess statistical differences between drug conditions.,1
A related approach using z-transformed bivariate correlation (ÔsimilarityÕ rather than distance) was also taken and results were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 3c).,1
"To test whether variability in participant-specific response to psilocybin was larger than would be expected by chance, we used a likelihood ratio test for variance of random slopes for a participant-specific response to psilocybin48.",1
The difference in log likelihood ratios was compared to a null distribution of 1_million draws from a mixture of chi-squared distributions with degrees of freedom 1 and 2.,1
We note that the likelihood ratio test of variance components is a non-standard problem47 as the covariance matrix of the random effects is positive definite and the variances of random effects are non-negative.,1
"Finally, the test statistic for the likelihood ratio in this LME model was compared against a 50/50 mixture of two independent chi-squared distributions, each with one and two degrees of freedom, respectively.",1
Subjective experience was assessed for drug sessions using the MEQ3046 (Supplementary Methods).,1
The MEQ30 is designed to capture the core domains of the subjective effects of psychedelics (as compared to the altered states of consciousness rating scales that more broadly assess effects of psychoactive drugs122) and is related to the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics.,1
"We applied a LME model across all drug sessions, similar to the one described above, but with MEQ30 total score as the dependent variable.",1
"Whole-brain FC change and framewise displacement were modelled as fixed effects, and participant was modelled as a random effect.",1
The same model was solved using FC change from every vertex to generate a vertex-wise map of the FC change versus MEQ30.,1
"The conditions above were compared by calculating normalized FC change scores using the following procedure: we (1) determined FC change for each condition compared to baseline as described above, (2) subtracted within-session distance for all conditions (such that within-session FC change was 0), (3) divided all conditions by day-to-day distance (such that day-to-day FC change was equal to 1).",1
"Thus, normalized whole-brain FC change values (for example, psilocybin versus base was 3.52) could be thought of as proportional to day-to-day variability.",1
"We used a classical MDS approach to cluster parcellated connectomes across fMRI scans, as previously described38.",1
"This data-driven approach was used to identify how different parameters (for example, task, drug, individual) affect similarity and/or distance between networks.",1
"MDS places data in multidimensional space on the basis of the dissimilarity (Euclidean distance) among data points, which in this case means a data point represents the linearized upper triangle of a FC matrix.",1
"Every matrix was entered into the classical MDS algorithm (implemented using MATLAB 2019, cmdscale.m).",1
Many dimensions of the data were explored.,1
The eigenvectors were multiplied by the original FC matrices to generate a matrix of eigenweights that corresponded to each dimension.,1
These eigenweights were also applied to other rs-fMRI psychedelics datasets to generate dimensions scores (section ÔOther datasetsÕ).,1
"Rotation-based null model (spin test) for network specificity
To assess network specificity of FC change values, we calculated average FC change of matched null networks consisting of randomly rotated networks with preserved size, shape and relative position to each other62,97.",1
"To create matched random networks, we rotated each hemisphere of the original networks a random amount around the x, y and z axes on the spherical expansion of the cortical surface62.",1
"This procedure randomly relocated each network while maintaining networksÕ sizes, shapes and relative positions to each other.",1
"Random rotation followed by computation of network-average FC change score was repeated 1,000 times to generate null distributions of FC change scores.",1
Vertices rotated into the medial wall were not included in the calculation.,1
Actual psilocybin FC change was then compared to null rotation permutations to generate a P value for the 12 networks that were consistently present across every participantÕs Infomap parcellation.,1
For bar graph visualization (Fig.,1
1 and Supplementary Fig.,1
"1b), networks with greater change (P_<_0.05 based on null rotation permutations) are shown in their respective colour and other networks are shown in grey.",1
We used an approach previously validated to assess spatial complexity (termed entropy) or neural signals61.,1
"Temporal principal component analysis was conducted on the full BOLD dense timeseries, which yielded m principal components (m roughly 80_K surface vertices and subcortical voxels) and associated eigenvalues.",1
"The normalized eigenvalue of the ith principal component was calculated as
The NGSC computed above attains values from the interval 0 to 1.",1
"The lowest value NGSC_=_0 would mean the brain-wide BOLD signal consisted of exactly one principal component or spatial mode, and there is maximum global FC between all vertices.",1
"The highest value NGSC_=_1 would mean the total data variance is uniformly distributed across all m principal components, and a maximum spatial complexity or a lowest FC is found.",1
NGSC was additionally calculated at the Ôparcel levelÕ.,1
"To respect areal boundaries, this was done by first generating a set of individual-specific parcels in every participant (on all available resting fMRI sessions concatenated) using procedures described oreviously39,62.",1
NGSC maps were compared to PET-based 5-HT2A receptor binding maps published in ref. 33,1
Similarity was assessed by computing the bivariate correlation between NGSC values and 5-HT2A binding across 324 cortical parcels from the GordonÐLaumann parcellation.,1
"To assess the persistent effects of psilocybin, we compared FC changes 1Ð21_days postpsilocybin to predrug baseline.",1
The FC change analysis (described above) indicated that connectivity at the whole-brain level did not change following psilocybin (Supplementary Fig. 1).,1
A screen was conducted with P_<_0.05 threshold to identify brain networks or areas showing persistent effects.,1
This analysis identified the anterior hippocampus as a candidate region of interest for persistent FC change (section ÔBaseline/after psilocybin FC change analysisÕ in Supplementary Methods).,1
We assessed change in anterior hippocampus ÔFC changeÕ pre- versus postpsilocybin using the LME model described previously.,1
"In this model, all sessions before psilocybin (irrespective or cross-over order) were labelled as prepsilocybin and all sessions within 21_days after psilocybin were labelled as postpsilocybin.",1
"As a control, we tested anterior hippocampus FC change pre- versus post-MTP using both the LME model, and an equivalence test.",1
"To control for potential persistent psilocybin effects, only the block of scans immediately before and after MTP were used (for example, if a participant took MTP as drug 1, then all baseline scans were labelled as Ôpre-MTPÕ and all scans between drugs 1 and 2 were labelled Ôpost-MTPÕ).",1
Equivalence testing (to conclude no change in anterior hippocampus after MTP) was accomplished by setting __=_0.5 standard deviation of FC change across pre-MTP sessions.,1
We computed the 90% CI of change in FC change between pre- and post-MTP sessions.,1
"If the bounds of the 90% CI were within ±_, then equivalence was determined123.",1
"Raw fMRI and structural data published previously55,56 were run through our in-house registration and processing pipeline described above.",1
"These datasets were used for replication, external validation and generalization to another classic psychedelic (that is, LSD) for the measures described above (for example, NGSC and the MDS-derived psilocybin FC dimension, dimension 1).",1
"Using the data from ref. 55: n_=_15 healthy adults (five women, mean age 34.1 years, s.d. 8.2) completed two scanning sessions (psilocybin and saline) that included an eyes-closed resting-state BOLD scan for 6_min before and following i.v. infusion of drug.",1
"fMRI data were acquired using a gradient-echo-planar imaging sequence, TR and TE of 3,000 and 35_ms, field-of-view 192_mm, 64___64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor of 2 and 90¡ flip angle.",1
Using the data from ref.,1
"56: healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (LSD and saline), which included an eyes-closed resting-state BOLD scan acquired for 22_min following i.v.",1
drug infusion lasting 12_min.,1
"n_=_20 participants completed the protocol, but data were used for n_=_15 (four women; mean age 30.5, standard deviation 8.0) deemed suitable for BOLD analyses.",1
"fMRI data were acquired using a gradient-echo-planar imaging sequence, TR and TE of 2,000 and 35_ms, field-of-view 220_mm, 64___64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor of 2, 90¡ flip angle and 3.4_mm isotropic voxels.",1
"The ABCD database resting-state functional MRI59 (annual release v.2.0, 10.15154/1503209) was used to replicate the effects of stimulant use on FC.",1
Preprocessing included framewise censoring with a criterion of frame displacement less than or equal to 0.2_mm in addition the standard predefined preprocessing procedures124.,1
Participants with fewer than 600 frames (equivalent to 8_min of data after censoring) were excluded from the analysis.,1
Parcel-wise group-averaged FC matrices were constructed for each participant as described above for 385 regions on inter-test in the brain.,1
"Use of a stimulant (for example, MTP, amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine) in the last 24_h was assessed by parental report.",1
Participants with missing data were excluded.,1
Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between FC (edges) and stimulant use in the last 24_h.,1
Framewise displacement (averaged over frames remaining after censoring) was used as a covariate to account for motion-related effects.,1
The t-values that reflect the relationship between stimulant use and FC were visualized on a colour scale from _5 to +5 to provide a qualitative information about effect of stimulant use on FC.,1
"A single dose of psilocybin, a psychedelic that acutely causes distortions of spaceÐtime perception and ego dissolution, produces rapid and persistent therapeutic effects in human clinical trials1Ð4.",1
"In animal models, psilocybin induces neuroplasticity in cortex and hippocampus5Ð8.",1
It remains unclear how human brain network changes relate to subjective and lasting effects of psychedelics.,1
Here we tracked individual-specific brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping (roughly 18 magnetic resonance imaging visits per participant).,1
"Healthy adults were tracked before, during and for 3_weeks after high-dose psilocybin (25_mg) and methylphenidate (40_mg), and brought back for an additional psilocybin dose 6Ð12_months later.",1
"Psilocybin massively disrupted functional connectivity (FC) in cortex and subcortex, acutely causing more than threefold greater change than methylphenidate.",1
"These FC changes were driven by brain desynchronization across spatial scales (areal, global), which dissolved network distinctions by reducing correlations within and anticorrelations between networks.",1
"Psilocybin-driven FC changes were strongest in the default mode network, which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and is thought to create our sense of space, time and self.",1
Individual differences in FC changes were strongly linked to the subjective psychedelic experience.,1
Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-driven FC changes.,1
"Psilocybin caused persistent decrease in FC between the anterior hippocampus and default mode network, lasting for weeks.",1
Persistent reduction of hippocampal-default mode network connectivity may represent a neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate of the proplasticity and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.,1
"Healthy adults were tracked before, during and after high doses of psilocybin and methylphenidate to assess how psychedelics can change human brain networks, and psilocybin was found to massively disrupt functional connectivity in cortex and subcortex with some changes persisting for weeks.",1
"Psychedelic drugs can reliably induce powerful acute changes in the perception of self, time and space by agonism of the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor9,10.",1
"In clinical trials, a single high dose of psilocybin (25_mg) has demonstrated rapid and sustained symptom relief in depression1Ð3,11Ð14, addiction4,15 and end-of-life anxiety13,14.",1
"Together, these observations indicate that psychedelics should induce potent acute (lasting roughly 6_hours) and persistent (24_hours to 21_days) neurobiological changes.",1
"In rodent models, transient activation of the 5-HT2A receptors by a psychedelic can alter neuronal communication in 5-HT2A-rich regions (for example, the medial frontal lobe) and induce persistent plasticity-related phenomena5Ð7.",1
"Synaptogenesis in the medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus is thought to be key to the neurotrophic antidepressant effects of psilocybin5,16,17.",1
"Yet, inherent limitations of rodent models, and imperfect homology to the human 5-HT2A receptor18, limit the generalizability of these assertions.",1
Understanding the effects of psychedelics on human brain networks is critical to unlocking their therapeutic mechanisms.,1
"In humans, during the roughly 6_hour duration of action, psilocybin increases glutamate signalling and glucose metabolism19Ð21, broadly decreases the power of electrophysiological signals22, reduces hemodynamic fluctuations23 and decreases segregation between functional networks24.",1
"The drivers of these acute changes are poorly understood, particularly in the subcortex.",1
Preliminary efforts to identify network changes in the weeks after psilocybin have yielded mixed results25Ð27.,1
Persistent effects of psilocybin on clinically relevant circuits have yet to be characterized in humans.,1
"The ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior and middle hippocampus are functionally connected to the default mode network (DMN)28,29.",1
"Increased FC between the hippocampus and DMN has been associated with depression symptoms30 and decreased FC is associated with treatment31,32.",1
These 5-HT2A receptor rich33 and depression associated default mode regions34Ð36 are candidates for mediating the neurotrophic antidepressant effects of psychedelics.,1
Precision functional mapping uses dense repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sampling37Ð41 to reveal the time course of individual-specific intervention-driven brain changes42.,1
This approach accounts for inter-individual variability in brain networks37 and capitalizes on the high stability of networks within individuals from day to day38.,1
"Using precision functional mapping, we observed individual-specific acute and persistent brain changes following a single high dose of psilocybin.",1
"Healthy young adults received 25 mg psilocybin and 40 mg methylphenidate (MTP, generic name Ritalin, dose-matched for arousal effects) 1Ð2_weeks apart and underwent regular MRI sessions (roughly 18 per participant) before, during, between and after the two drug doses (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Video 1: data quality metrics for 129 total MRI visits).",1
Dense predrug sampling familiarized participants with the scanner and established baseline variability.,1
"Psilocybin acutely caused profound and widespread brain FC changes (Fig. 1a) across most of the cerebral cortex (P_<_0.05 based on two-sided linear mixed-effects (LME) model and permutation testing), but most prominent in association networks (FC change mean (standard deviation, s.d.): association cortex 0.44 (0.03), primary cortex 0.36 (0.05)).",1
"In the subcortex the largest psilocybin-associated FC changes were seen in DMN connected parts of the thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum and hippocampus29,43,44 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2).",1
"In the hippocampus, foci of strong FC disruption were located in the anterior hippocampus (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates _24, _22, _16 and 24, _18, _16).",1
Other large FC disruptions were seen in mediodorsal and paraventricular thalamus45 and anteromedial caudate.,1
"In the cerebellum, the largest FC changes were seen in the DMN connected areas44 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2).",1
"By comparison, MTP-associated FC changes localized to sensorimotor systems (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2) and paralleled the map of day-to-day variability (Fig. 1c) probably due to arousal effects39.",1
"Psilocybin-associated FC change was largest in the DMN (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1; averaged across all psilocybin sessions; spin test, 1,000 permutations, one-sided Pspin_<_0.001; Pspin_>_0.05 for all other networks).",1
"However, MTP-associated FC change was largest in motor and action networks (Pspin_=_0.002; Pspin_>_0.05 for all other networks; Supplementary Fig. 1b).",1
"Despite MTP and psilocybin causing similar increases in heart rate (Supplementary Fig. 2), the effects of psilocybin on FC were more than threefold larger than the effects of MTP (Fig. 1b).",1
"The psilocybin effects also dwarfed those of other control conditions (Fig. 1e; day-to-day change (normalized) 1; task 1.22, MTP 1.10, high head motion 1.29, psilocybin 3.52, between person 3.53; Extended Data Fig. 3; these effects were robust to preprocessing choices: Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).",1
"To put the effects of psilocybin into perspective, it helps to consider that the mean changes in brain organization caused by the drug were as large as the differences in brain organization between different people (Fig. 1e).",1
"The large amount of data collected per participant, under the individual-specific imaging model, allowed us to move beyond group-analyses and compare the subjective psychedelic experience (30-item Mystical Experience Questionnaire, MEQ30)46 to brain function data session-by-session (Fig. 46).",1
"The MEQ30 is a self-assessment instrument used to measure the intensity and quality of mystical experiences, including feelings of connectedness, transcendence of time and space, and a sense of awe, with a maximum score of 150 (ref. 46).",1
"Across psilocybin sessions and participants, FC change tracked with the intensity of the subjective experience (Fig. 4).",1
"Correlating the whole-brain FC change (x axis) against the MEQ30 scores (y axis) for all drug sessions (Fig. 1g) revealed an r2_=_0.81 (LME model predicting MEQ30 score: effect of FC change, t(13)_=_7.68; P_=_3.5___10_6, uncorrected).",1
"Head motion was not significantly correlated with MEQ30 scores (effect of framewise displacement, t(13)_=__1.26, P_=_0.23, uncorrected).",1
"Projecting the relationship between someoneÕs mystical experience and the corresponding FC change onto the brain (Fig. 1h, vertex-wise) showed it to be driven by association cortex, relatively sparing primary motor and sensory regions.",1
"Of the four MEQ30 dimensions (mystical, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and ineffability), the one most strongly correlating with brain change was transcendence (for example, Ôloss of your usual sense of time or spaceÕ, r2_=_0.86, Supplementary Fig. 5), however, all dimensions were highly correlated (r_>_0.8).",1
"Repeated sampling enabled us to determine that the inter-individual variability in the effects of psilocybin in the brain was more likely related to differences in drug effects than measurement error (likelihood ratio test of participant-specific response to psilocybin, P_=_0.00245, uncorrected)47,48.",1
To examine the latent dimensions of brain network changes we performed multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the parcellated FC matrices from every fMRI scan38.,1
"MDS is blind to session labels (for example, drug, participant).",1
"Yet, dimension 1, which explained the largest amount of variability, separated psilocybin from other scans (Fig. 2a), apart from one session during which the participant (P5R) had emesis 30_minutes after taking psilocybin (dark red dots on the left of Fig. 2a).",1
"The higher score on dimension 1 associated with psilocybin, corresponded to reduced segregation between the DMN and other networks (fronto-parietal49, dorsal attention50, salience51 and action-mode52,53) that are typically anticorrelated with it54 (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5).",1
"To determine whether this reflects a common effect of psilocybin that generalizes across datasets and psychedelics, we calculated dimension 1 scores for extant datasets from participants receiving intravenous (i.v.) psilocybin55 and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)56.",1
"Psychedelic treatment increased dimension 1 in nearly every participant in the psilocybin and LSD datasets (Fig. 2c), suggesting that this is a common effect across psychedelic drugs and individuals.",1
Subtraction of average FC (psilocybin minus baseline) revealed a pattern of FC change similar to dimension 1 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6).,1
"Consistent with previous psychedelics studies24, psilocybin increased FC between networks (particularly fronto-parietal, default mode and dorsal attention), whereas FC within networks was relatively less affected.",1
"A similar pattern of loss of segregation between brain networks is produced by nitrous oxide and ketamine57, suggesting that the psychedelic dimension observed here may generalize to psychedelic-like dissociative drugs.",1
"By comparison, MTP decreased within-network FC in the sensory, motor and auditory regions (Extended Data Fig. 3a).",1
"To verify that observations in our sample (n_=_6) were generalizable, we compared stimulant effects in our study to those in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study59 (n_=_487 taking stimulants).",1
The effect of stimulant use in ABCD was consistent with MTP-associated FC changes in our dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3a).,1
Multi-unit recording studies suggest that agonism of 5-HT2A receptors by psychedelics desynchronizes populations of neurons that typically co-activate60.,1
"We proposed that this phenomenon, observed at a larger spatial scale, might account for psilocybin-associated FC change (Fig. 3a).",1
We observed that the typically stable spatial structure of resting fMRI fluctuations was disrupted and desynchronized by psilocybin (Supplementary Videos 2Ð7: brain activity time courses during drug sessions for each participant).,1
"Therefore, we quantified brain signal synchrony using normalized global spatial complexity (NGSC): a measure of spatial entropy that is independent of the number of signals61.",1
NGSC calculates cumulative variance explained by subsequent spatiotemporal patterns (Fig. 3a).,1
The lowest value of NGSC (0) means that the time course for every vertex and/or voxel is identical.,1
"The highest value of NGSC (equal to one) means that the time course for every vertex and/or voxel is independent, indicating maximal desynchronization (or spatial entropy).",1
"Psilocybin significantly increased NGSC acutely with values returning to predrug baseline by the following session (Fig. 3b,c).",1
"The increase in NGSC was observed at the whole-brain level (Fig. 3b; LME model, estimate (95% confidence interval (CI))_=_0.0510 (0.0343, 0.0676), t(265)_=_6.8, P_=_2.0___10_6, uncorrected) and correlated with the subjective experience (MEQ30: Extended Data Fig. 7; r_=_0.80, P_=_3.52___10_4, uncorrected, after single outlier removal), whereas nuisance variables did not.",1
