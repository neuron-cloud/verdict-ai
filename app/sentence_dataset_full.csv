A quick intro, my name is Mychael Delgardo, the President of the Class of 2023, and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I went to school at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where I graduated in May 2019 and matriculated to VP&S as a straight-through applicant. I can probably provide insight into most questions/concerns concerning on-campus living, NY life compared to different parts of the country (West and South), and being involved in multiple different things on campus early and often (student council, research, clubs, volunteering, etc.).
